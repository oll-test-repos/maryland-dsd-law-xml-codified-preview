EPA periodically updates the schedule of user fees and publishes the updated fee schedule to ensure that the e-manifest user community is aware of the revisions, as provided in 40 CFR §264.1313. An owner or operator subject to these user fees is required by EPA to make user fee payments in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR §264.1314, subject to the informal fee dispute resolution process of 40 CFR §264.1316, and subject to the sanctions for delinquent payments under 40 CFR §264.1315.</aftertext>

The Department may extend the duration of this operational period once, for up to 720 additional hours, at the request of the applicant when good cause is shown.
