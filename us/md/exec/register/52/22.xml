              <aftertext>The electricity delivered to your home is generated from a variety of sources, both renewable and nonrenewable. Energy from renewable resources, such as wind and solar, cannot be tracked directly into your home. Instead, the energy your home uses will support renewable energy sources through the purchase of renewable energy credits (“RECs”). A REC represents the environmental and social good associated with 1 megawatt hour of renewable electricity generation. RECs may be sold separately from the electricity itself, so the buyer of a REC may be different than the buyer of the electricity. In your contract, X% of the RECs qualify for Maryland’s renewable portfolio standard. By purchasing RECs that qualify for Maryland’s renewable portfolio standard, you are supporting renewable energy development in the region. Increased demand for, and generation of, renewable electricity can help reduce conventional electricity generation from fossil fuels in the region where the renewable electricity generator is located. It may also have other environmental benefits such as reducing regional air pollution.</aftertext>
