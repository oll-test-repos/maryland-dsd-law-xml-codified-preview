      <para>

        <text>Subject to the prohibition in §A, any type of contract which shall promote the best interests of the State may be used. However, preference shall be given in the order indicated to the following types of contracts:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>Fixed-price;</text>

      </para>
      <para>

        <text>The objective when selecting a contract type is to obtain the best value in the time required and at the lowest cost or price or greatest revenue to the State. In order to achieve this objective, the procurement officer, before choosing a contract type, should review those elements of the procurement which directly affect the cost, time, risk, and profit incentives bearing on the performance.</text>

        <text>Fixed-Price Contract Generally. A fixed-price contract is appropriate for use when the extent and type of work necessary to meet State requirements can be reasonably specified and the cost can be reasonably estimated, as is generally the case for construction or standard commercial products. A fixed-price type of contract is the only type of contract that can be used in competitive sealed bidding.</text>

        <text>Generally, a cost-reimbursement contract is appropriate when the uncertainties involved in contract performance are of such magnitude that the cost of contract performance cannot be estimated with sufficient certainty to realize economy by use of any type of fixed-price contract.

    <heading>Multi-Year Contracts.</heading>
    <para>

      <text>Application. A multi-year contract is appropriate when it is in the best interest of the State to obtain uninterrupted services extending over more than one fiscal period, when the performance of the services involves high start-up costs, or when a changeover of services contractors involves high phase-in/phase-out costs during a transition period. The multi-year method of contracting is also appropriate when special production of definite quantities of supplies for more than one fiscal period is necessary to best meet the State needs but funds are available only for the initial fiscal period.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>Objective. The objective of the multi-year contract is to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by obtaining the benefits of sustained volume production and consequent low prices, and by increasing competitive participation in procurements which involve special production or high phase-in/phase-out costs during changeover of service contractors.</text>

    <heading>Multiple Awards.</heading>
    <text>When a multiple award is made, all State agencies shall order all of their actual normal requirements for the specified supplies or services from contractors awarded the contract. A multiple award may be in the State's best interest when an award to two or more bidders or offerors for similar products is needed for adequate delivery, service, availability, or for product compatibility. In making a multiple award, care shall be exercised to protect and promote the principles of competitive solicitation. Multiple awards may not be made when a single award will meet the State's needs without sacrifice of economy or service.</text>
