      <text>Definition. "Multi-step sealed bidding" means a two-phase process in which bidders submit unpriced technical offers or samples, or both, to be reviewed by the State and a second phase in which those bidders whose technical offers or samples, or both, have been found to be acceptable during the first phase have their price bids considered.</text>

      <num>B.</num>
      <text>Conditions for Use. Multi-step sealed bidding may be used when it is determined by the procurement officer that it is impracticable to initially prepare specifications to support an award based solely on bid price.</text>
