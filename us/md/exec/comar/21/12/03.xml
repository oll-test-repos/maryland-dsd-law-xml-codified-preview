    <text>Architectural and engineering services contracts costing $200,000 or less awarded through the Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Department of General Services (DGS) result from solicitations and negotiations conducted by the Procuring Agency requiring the services. A list of candidate consultants, consisting of two or more consultants qualified to perform the services, is established by staff within the Procuring Agency. The consultants on the candidate list are requested to submit technical proposals for the requested services. The technical proposals are evaluated by staff within the Procuring Agencies Evaluation Committee and a recommendation for selection is made to the Procurement Agency head or designee. A contract for the requested services is then negotiated with the selected consultant subject to review and approval by the Procurement Agency head or designee.</text>
