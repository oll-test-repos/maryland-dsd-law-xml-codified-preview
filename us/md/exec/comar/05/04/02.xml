      <text>Objective. The objective of this section is to assure a high degree of safety to life and property preservation, by the separation of living units and the use of materials which will retard the spread of fire and prevent the passage of flame, smoke, and hot gases through open or concealed spaces within the building. An additional objective of this section is to provide means of egress which will permit persons to leave the building with safety in an emergency, and permit access for fire control personnel.</text>

The blank spaces in the table mean the tank size would be either too small to provide sufficient hot water, or too large a tank to be practical.</aftertext>
