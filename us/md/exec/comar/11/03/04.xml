    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>In order to further the public interest and aeronautical progress, provide for the protection and promotion of safety in aeronautics, contribute to the principle of effecting uniform regulations of aeronautics, and in order that those engaged in aeronautics of every character may so engage with the least possible restriction consistent with the safety and rights of others, these regulations have been adopted by the Maryland Aviation Administration of the Maryland Department of Transportation.
