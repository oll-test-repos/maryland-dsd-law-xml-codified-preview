    <text>At least one rear wheel and drum assembly shall be removed (for inspection of linings on vehicles equipped with drum brakes) from a three-wheeled multipurpose vehicle for lining, drum, and component inspection. Removal of a wheel on any other motorcycle shall be required only if any malfunction of braking is discovered during a road test. 1974 and newer motorcycles have a means of inspecting brake lining thickness without removing a wheel.</text>
