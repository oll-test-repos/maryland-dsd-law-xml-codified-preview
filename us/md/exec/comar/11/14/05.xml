    <text>The standards, requirements, and procedures set forth in this chapter are applicable to equipment originally installed by the manufacturer or required by federal or State requirement on trailers (including pole trailers, semitrailers, camping trailers, trailers so designed or manufactured for the purpose of moving modular homes, travel trailers) and any questions regarding these standards or specifications shall be referred to the Automotive Safety Enforcement Division of the Maryland State Police. Any person constructing or reconstructing a vehicle shall assure the vehicle meets or exceeds all applicable federal and State safety standards.</text>

Trailers and semitrailers to be registered over 10,000 pounds GVWR shall have brakes on all wheels. At least one wheel and drum shall be removed from each axle equipped with drum brakes. On disc brakes only wheel assembly removal is necessary. On trailers and semitrailers with brakes on more than one axle, wheel assembly removal shall be on alternate sides.

      <text>Air Brake Leakage. Before conducting these inspections, it may be desirable to install in the system an air gauge (0—150 psi) which has 5 or 10 psi increments, so that small changes in pressure can be more easily observed. Also, to eliminate the possibility of leakage being in the system of the towing vehicle, conduct air leakage tests on the uncoupled towing vehicle before inspecting the system of the trailer or semitrailer.</text>

    <heading>Rear Metal Frame.</heading>
    <text>Every trailer or semitrailer of a gross weight of 3,000 pounds or more when operated upon a highway shall be equipped with a permanent metal frame attached to the underside of the rear of the vehicle. The frame may not be any wider than the width of the vehicle and may not be more than 30 inches above the highway when moving and shall be constructed of heavy gauge steel. The maximum transverse distance from the widest part of the vehicle at the rear to the frame may not exceed 18 inches. The frame shall be constructed so as not to interfere with lights or other warning devices. Any trailer or semitrailer so constructed and maintained so that the body, chassis, or other parts thereof afford protection required by this section, shall be deemed to be in compliance. The provisions of this section do not apply to pole trailers or to vehicles where the installation of the required frame would prevent operation of the vehicle to secure its designed use.</text>

    <heading>Rear Wheel Protector Flaps.</heading>
    <text>Every trailer or semitrailer when operated upon a highway shall be equipped with suitable metal protectors or substantial flexible flaps behind the rearmost wheels of the vehicle to prevent the projection of rocks, dirt, water, or other substances to the rear and to minimize side spray.
