    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>This chapter is intended to provide minimum standards for the design, construction, and equipment of Type I school vehicles manufactured for sale in Maryland. These regulations are intended to enhance 49 CFR standards. When CFR standards supersede Maryland standards, CFR standards are to be used to construct Maryland-certified school vehicles.</text>
