      <text>It is the policy of the Department of Transportation that the Department, and each of its administrations, agencies, boards, commissions, and other units, conduct its affairs with an awareness of its responsibility for the protection of the environment for the present and future. The Maryland Environmental Policy Act (Act), Chapter 703 of the Laws of 1973, as codified in §§1-301—1-305, <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gnr">Natural Resources Article, Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>, mandates that State agencies, in balancing economic development and environmental quality, shall engage in thoughtful consideration of the environmental effects of their proposed actions, including: ecological, socio-economic, developmental, recreational, historic, architectural, aesthetic, and other values. Environmental assessment forms (EAF) and environmental effects reports (EER), as defined in the guidelines of the Department of Natural Resources adopted pursuant to the Act, will be utilized by the Department to accomplish this purpose, as well as to purpose, as well as to increase public participation in the planning of Departmental projects and to provide the General Assembly with additional social, economic, and natural environmental information to assist it in deciding upon legislative appropriations for projects in the annual capital budget.</text>

        <text>The EAF (an example of which appears in Regulation .08A) consists of a list of questions which can be answered "yes", or "no", or "comments attached". The answers to the questions on the environmental assessment form will assist in determining whether or not an environmental effects report will be prepared. An answer of "yes" will generate a presumption in favor of preparation of an environmental effects report. However, this presumption may be overcome by the official preparing the assessment form by checking "comments attached" and explaining why an action in his opinion needs no environmental report even though some of the questions of the EAF are answered affirmatively.</text>

      <text>Environmental Effects Report (EER). An environmental effects report (EER) will consist of an environmental assessment form (See Regulation .08A) which will be attached to the front of every EER, and the body of the EER report. The amount of detail provided in the report will be commensurate with the extent of the expected impact of the action. In general, the greater the magnitude of impact the more detailed will be the discussion. For a particular action, some sections will be given more attention than others. Sections which are especially relevant to a particular action will be treated extensively. Nevertheless, each section will be given at least summary treatment. The body of every report shall contain the following sections:</text>

        <text>Summary of Environmental Effects Report. The summary, the purpose of which is to enable the General Assembly and the public to determine quickly the nature, location, alternatives to, and effects of, any particular agency action, shall:</text>

Public facilities and public investments that might result if the proposed action is taken will be discussed. If the action is a portion of a larger action, then the relationship of the action under consideration to the larger action will be discussed.

      <text>State System Projects. The Department's capital budget request asks for program rather than specific project appropriations. Therefore, the forms and reports will be related to phases of project development as defined in the part of the Action Plan applicable to the modal administration which develops the project and the consolidated transportation program which supplements the budget request. The form and, when necessary, report will be developed for State projects during the planning phase which is the first phase of the project development. The scope and general characteristics of the project are defined during this phase. The reports will be available to the public and submitted to the State Clearinghouse before the next phase of project development, the final design, in which the detailed specifications of the project are defined. The design phase precedes the time a State project is scheduled for right-of-way acquisition and construction in the Department's consolidated transportation program. Thus, the reports will be on file before the request to fund the budget year of the consolidated transportation program in which the right-of-way or construction phases of the project are scheduled to start.</text>

      <text>Many programs and projects of the Department use federal funds and are therefore subject to national environmental requirements. Most of these projects, for example, come within the coverage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), passed by the Congress in 1969 and effective as of January 1, 1970. In many respects, the environmental impact statement and the environmental effects report required under the Maryland Environmental Policy Act (ACT) are similar both in purpose and in content.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>The federal law and the State law clearly overlap in many respects. The Maryland Department of Transportation feels it would be inefficient to duplicate the effort involved in preparing a separate State environmental effects report on any program or project for which a federal environmental impact statement is also required. Therefore, one report will be developed covering the requirements under both laws.</text>
