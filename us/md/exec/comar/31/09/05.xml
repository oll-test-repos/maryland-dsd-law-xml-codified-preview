    <text>REPLACEMENT OF LIFE INSURANCE OR ANNUITIES</text>
    <text>This document shall be signed by the applicant and the insurance producer, if there is one, and a copy left with the applicant.</text>
    <text>You are contemplating the purchase of a life insurance policy or annuity contract. In some cases this purchase may involve discontinuing or changing an existing life insurance policy or annuity contract. If so, a replacement is occurring. Financed purchases are also considered replacements.</text>
    <text>A replacement occurs when a new life insurance policy or annuity contract is purchased and, in connection with the sale, you discontinue making premium payments on the existing life insurance policy or annuity contract, or an existing life insurance policy or annuity contract is surrendered, forfeited, assigned to the replacing insurer, or otherwise terminated or used in a financed purchase.</text>
    <text>A financed purchase occurs when the purchase of a new life insurance policy involves the use of funds obtained by the withdrawal or surrender of or by borrowing some or all of the life insurance policy values, including accumulated dividends, of an existing life insurance policy to pay all or part of any premium or payment due on the new life insurance policy. A financed purchase is a replacement.</text>
    <text>You should carefully consider whether a replacement is in your best interest. You will pay acquisition costs and there may be surrender costs deducted from your life insurance policy or annuity contract. You may be able to make changes to your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract to meet your insurance needs at less cost. A financed purchase will reduce the value of your existing life insurance policy and may reduce the amount paid upon the death of the insured.</text>
    <text>We want you to understand the effects of replacements before you make your purchase decision and ask that you answer the following questions and consider the questions on the back of this form.</text>
    <para>
      <num>1.</num>
      <text>Are you considering discontinuing making premium payments, surrendering, forfeiting, assigning to the insurer, or otherwise terminating your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract?</text>

    <aftertext>If you answered "yes" to either of the above questions, list each existing life insurance policy or annuity contract you are contemplating replacing (include the name of the insurer, the insured or annuitant, and the life insurance policy or annuity contract number if available) and whether each life insurance policy or annuity contract will be replaced or used as a source of financing:</aftertext>

    <aftertext>A replacement may not be in your best interest, or your decision could be a good one. You should make a careful comparison of the costs and benefits of your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract and the proposed life insurance policy or annuity contract. One way to do this is to ask the company or insurance producer that sold you your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract to provide you with information concerning your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract. This may include an illustration of how your existing life insurance policy or annuity contract is working now and how it would perform in the future based on certain assumptions. Illustrations should not, however, be used as a sole basis to compare life insurance policies or annuity contracts. You should discuss the following with your insurance producer to determine whether replacement or financing your purchase makes sense:</aftertext>
    <aftertext>PREMIUMS: Are they affordable?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>Could they change?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>You are older—are premiums higher for the proposed new life insurance policy?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>How long will you have to pay premiums on the new life insurance policy? On the old life insurance policy?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>LIFE INSURANCE POLICY VALUES: New policies usually take longer to build cash values and to pay dividends.</aftertext>
    <aftertext>Acquisition costs for the old life insurance policy may have been paid, and you will incur costs for the new one.</aftertext>
    <aftertext>What surrender charges do the policies have?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>What expense and sales charges will you pay on the new life insurance policy?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>Does the new life insurance policy provide more insurance coverage?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>INSURABILITY: If your health has changed since you bought your old life insurance policy, the new one could cost you more, or you could be turned down.</aftertext>
    <aftertext>You may need a medical exam for a new life insurance policy.</aftertext>
    <aftertext>Claims on most new policies for up to the first 2 years can be denied based on inaccurate statements.</aftertext>
    <aftertext>Suicide limitations may begin anew on the new coverage.</aftertext>

    <aftertext>How will the premiums on your existing life insurance policy be affected?</aftertext>
    <aftertext>Will a loan be deducted from death benefits?</aftertext>
