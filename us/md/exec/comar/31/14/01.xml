    <text>The notice to an applicant regarding replacement of individual long-term care policies or other health insurance referred to in <cite path="|31|14|01|.06|E.">Regulation .06E of this chapter</cite> shall read as follows:</text>

    <text class="center">(Insurance company's name and address)</text>

    <text class="center">IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU IN THE FUTURE.</text>
    <text>According to [your application] [information you have furnished], you intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing long-term care or health insurance and replace it with an individual long-term care insurance policy to be issued by [company name] Insurance Company. Your new policy provides thirty (30) days within which you may decide, without cost, whether you desire to keep the policy. For your own information and protection, you should be aware of and seriously consider certain factors which may affect the insurance protection available to you under the new policy.</text>
    <text>You should review this new coverage carefully, comparing it with all long-term care or health insurance coverage you now have, and terminate your present policy only if, after due consideration, you find that purchase of this long-term care coverage is a wise decision.</text>
    <text>STATEMENT TO APPLICANT BY AGENT [BROKER OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE]: (Use additional sheets, as necessary.)</text>
    <text>I have reviewed your current medical or health insurance coverage. I believe the replacement of insurance involved in this transaction materially improves your position. My conclusion has taken into account the following considerations, which I call to your attention:</text>
    <para>
      <num>1.</num>
      <text>Health conditions which you may presently have (preexisting conditions), may not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy. This could result in denial or delay in payment of benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present policy.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>2.</num>
      <text>The law provides that your replacement policy or certificate may not contain new preexisting conditions or probationary periods. The insurer will waive any time periods applicable to preexisting conditions or probationary periods in the new policy (or coverage) for similar benefits to the extent of time elapsed under the original policy or certificate.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>3.</num>
      <text>If you are replacing existing long-term care insurance coverage, you may wish to secure the advice of your present insurer or its agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present policy. This is not only your right, but it is also in your best interest to make sure you understand everything that is involved in replacing your present coverage.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>4.</num>
      <text>If, after you have thought about it, you still wish to terminate your present policy and replace it with new coverage, be certain to truthfully and completely answer all questions on the application concerning your medical health history. Failure to include all material medical information in an application may provide a basis for the company to deny any future claims and to refund your premium as though your policy had never been in force. After the application has been completed and before you sign it, reread it carefully to be certain that all information has been properly recorded.</text>

Carefully check the application and write to [company name and address] within thirty (30) days if any information is not correct and complete, or if any relevant matters and particularly any past medical history have been left out of the application.</text>

    <text>Dear [Applicant]:</text>
    <text>Your recent application for long-term care insurance included a "personal worksheet," which asked questions about your finances and your reasons for buying long-term care insurance. For your protection, State law requires us to consider this information when we review your application, to avoid selling a policy to those who may not need coverage.</text>
    <text>[Your answers indicate that long-term care insurance may not meet your financial needs. We suggest that you review the information provided along with your application, including the booklet "Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance" and the page titled "Things You Should Know Before Buying Long-Term Care Insurance." Your state insurance department also has information about long-term care insurance and may be able to refer you to a counselor free of charge who can help you decide whether to buy this policy.]</text>
    <text>[You chose not to provide any financial information for us to review.]</text>
    <text>Drafting Note: Choose the paragraph that applies.</text>
    <text>We have suspended our final review of your application. If, after careful consideration, you still believe this policy is what you want, check the appropriate box below and return this letter to us within the next 60 days. We will then continue reviewing your application and issue a policy if you meet our medical standards.</text>
    <text>If we do not hear from you within the next 60 days, we will close your file and not issue you a policy. You should understand that you will not have any coverage until we hear back from you, approve your application and issue you a policy.</text>
    <text>Please check one box and return in the enclosed envelope.</text>
