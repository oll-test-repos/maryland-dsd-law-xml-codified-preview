    <heading>Limitations of Sewerage System.</heading>
    <text>A sewage disposal utility may not be obliged to receive for treatment, or disposal, any material except sewage as defined in <cite path="20.75.01.03|B.|(6)">COMAR 20.75.01.03B(6)</cite>. Rain water discharged from roofs, lawns, paved areas, etc., is especially prohibited, unless the sewerage system is designed with collecting mains and a treatment plant of adequate size to accommodate this greater flow of liquid. The sewage disposal utility may not be obliged to receive for treatment or disposal any corrosive or toxic industrial liquid waste. Industrial liquid waste which has been treated to make it noncorrosive and nontoxic may be accepted for disposal provided the utility's plant is of sufficient size to accommodate it.</text>
