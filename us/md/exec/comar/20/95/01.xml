    <heading>Saving Clause.</heading>
    <text>The formulation of these regulations does not preclude the Commission from altering or amending them in whole or in part, or from requiring any other or additional service, equipment, facility, or standard, either upon complaint or upon its own motion, or upon the application of a motor vehicle owner. Furthermore, these standards do not relieve an owner or operator of any motor vehicle from any of his duties under any orders of the Commission which are not in conflict with these regulations or under the laws of this State.</text>

      <text>General. As used in this regulation, the terms “conviction” and “convicted of” include a finding of guilt in a criminal or motor vehicle proceeding, the entry of the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, a probation before judgment if the applicant has not yet completed the terms of the probation or if the applicant has been found to have violated the terms of probation, or has been found not criminally responsible pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-134. The terms of an applicant’s probation before judgment will be determined by referencing the sentencing and disposition date information contained in the background check or criminal history report provided with the application. Unless the background check or criminal history report indicates otherwise, there will be a presumption that the terms of the probation before judgment have been completed within the period indicated on the report and that the applicant has not violated the terms of the probation.</text>
