        <text>Caretaker Relative.</text>

          <text>"Caretaker relative" means a parent or other person related by blood, marriage, or adoption and living with and caring for an unmarried child younger than 21 years old who is deprived of parental support due to death, continued absence from the home, incapacitation of a parent, or unemployment of the principal wage earner parent. A parent whose absence is occasioned solely by reason of the performance of active duty in the uniformed service of the United States is not considered absent from the home. The following relatives and their spouses meet this definition: father, mother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew or niece, and persons of preceding generations as denoted by the prefix of grand, great, and great-great; persons who legally adopt a child or his parent as well as the natural and other legally adopted children of these persons; and other relatives of adoptive parents in accordance with State law. A caretaker relative retains his status as a caretaker relative when the only child or children in his custody receives SSI benefits. This is the only instance when a caretaker relative without children in an assistance unit qualifies as a caretaker relative.</text>
