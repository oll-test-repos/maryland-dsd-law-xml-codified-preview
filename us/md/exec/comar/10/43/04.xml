      <text>Preface. The Board of Chiropractic Examiners has established guidelines for licensure by credentials. This method of licensure is a special privilege granted by present statute, and is secured for those candidates who possess the necessary credentials required to practice chiropractic in the State. The requirements for licensure are stringent in order to insure the public is adequately protected and that licensure may be granted only to those who qualify by virtue of clinical competency and professional expertise.</text>

Since licensure by credentials is a privilege, the Board reserves the right to accept or deny this method of licensure based on <cite path="|10|43|04|.02">Regulation .02 of this chapter</cite>.</text>
