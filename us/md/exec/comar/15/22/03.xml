      <text>Application. A producer-applicant shall apply for either a Maryland organic certification pending or Maryland certified organic permit.

In either case, the producer-applicant shall apply on a form provided by the Department for each farm that is to produce organic products. The producer shall submit this application to the Department at least 60 days in advance of the producer's preparation or tilling of the proposed farm unit. In 1991, the Department may waive this 60-day requirement.</text>

After 3 years, unless credit already has been obtained under <cite path="15|22|03|.05|E.">§E of this regulation</cite>, the producer-applicant becomes eligible for, and shall obtain, a Maryland certified organic permit for this land or otherwise withdraw the land from the program for the next 2 years.</text>
