      <text>"Equine infectious anemia (swamp fever)" means a disease of equines caused by a virus which is infectious in nature and spreads from horse to horse by blood sucking insects, unsterile surgical instruments (especially hypodermic needles) and the community use of equipment that produces cuts and abrasions. The virus can infect both sexes, all age groups and all breeds and species of equines. Infected animals remain carriers of the disease for their entire lifetime, constituting a potential source of spread. The disease may be acute or chronic or inapparent. There is no known cure or treatment.</text>
