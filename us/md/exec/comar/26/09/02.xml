    <text>The purpose of this chapter is to establish emissions limitations and procedures that apply to CO<sub>2</sub> budget sources and units for the use of CO<sub>2</sub> allowances. In this chapter, compliance with emission limitations is achieved through a process that involves the transfer of allowances from and into CO<sub>2</sub> budget source accounts.</text>
