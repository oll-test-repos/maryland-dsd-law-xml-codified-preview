      <text>In Maryland, the term “Tier II water” is defined as a water body with water quality that measures significantly better than that required by water quality standards to support its designated uses. A Tier II watershed is defined as the area of land that contributes runoff to a Tier II waterbody and any discharges to streams upstream of and including the Tier II waterbody. Significantly better is evaluated statistically to demonstrate at least a 90 percent certainty that the mean of the available data is better than the applicable standard (for example, the criterion is outside the outer bound of the 90 percent confidence interval). Water quality is considered significantly better and waters may be listed as Tier II, if the exclusion under <cite path="26|08|02|.04-2|D.">§D of this regulation</cite> does not apply and if:</text>

      <text>Scope. There are many tools available to protect special resources including the Smart Growth Initiative, Rural Legacy Program, local comprehensive plans, Program Open Space, and others that work through the private sector and nongovernment organizations. This regulation applies the Tier III Outstanding National Resource Waters (ONRW) designation only where the most stringent protection is necessary and appropriate to protect and maintain existing exceptional resources. Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding national resource, such as waters of national and State parks and wildlife refuges, and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.</text>

      <text>Protection for Upstream Areas that Feed the ONRW Water Body. In determining whether to designate a body of water as ONRW, the Department may consider whether the watershed upstream of the proposed ONRW area has protections in place that are consistent with the maintenance and protection of biological resources in the ONRW segment. These protections can include, but are not limited to:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>A county comprehensive plan or other plan that designates the upstream watershed as a "no growth area"; or</text>

      <text>Endangered Species. If a nomination is based on a federally threatened or endangered wholly aquatic species, the Department may, but is not required to, designate a water body as an ONRW without requiring protected status. Although the presence of an endangered species may be an indication of a special biological resource, the primary protection for endangered species is provided by the Maryland Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act, <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gnr">Natural Resources Article, Title 10, Subtitle 2A, Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>, and the Federal Endangered Species Act. If an ONRW is approved for a body of water that is not in a protected status, any regulated activities in the watershed which would adversely impact the aquatic threatened or endangered species population, or impair the habitat required by the species, will require the maximum practical application of best management practices and implementation of antidegradation policies by the Department. The implementation requirements set forth in <cite path="26|08|02|.04-3|I.">§I of this regulation</cite> also apply.</text>

        <text>All geographic coordinates provided within this regulation are expressed in decimal degrees latitude and longitude using the North American Datum of 1983. In this regulation, Maryland's waters are organized by sub-basin. For most Class I, I-P, III, III-P, IV, or IV-P waters, the limits indicate the most downstream boundary point or line for the segment. In some cases, an upstream point and a downstream point are provided to describe those uses that may apply only to a limited segment of a water body. In tidal areas, the segments are defined by polygons defined by three or more points as numbered and expressed in narrative format in column four and defined by latitude and longitude point locations in columns two and three.

        <text>Existing Uses. Several of the sub-basins in this regulation contain stream segments that support existing uses that require different water quality than the designated use. These existing uses have been determined in accordance with <cite path="|26|08|02|.04-1">Regulation .04-1 of this chapter</cite>. The existing uses for these stream segments are described both in terms of the existing uses supported (e.g., naturalized reproducing brown trout population) and the water quality currently known to sustain them. For determining effluent limits, closure periods, and other regulatory protection measures, these existing uses and the water quality necessary to maintain them must be protected consistent with <cite path="|26|08|02|.04-1">Regulation .04-1 of this chapter</cite>. These existing uses are maintained and can be accessed on the Department’s website.</text>
