      <text>The purpose of this chapter is to establish a Water Quality Trading Program between the agricultural, stormwater, wastewater, and on-site sewage disposal sectors that attracts public and private participation and enhances Maryland’s effort to protect and restore not only the water resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, but also local waters. Trading may supplement the more traditional governmental approaches for improving water quality and has the potential to achieve results faster and at a lower cost, accelerating efforts to restore and improve water quality. The Program expands opportunities for point sources and nonpoint sources by creating a water quality marketplace that allows them to meet and maintain pollutant load limits through the acquisition of credits generated by pollutant load reductions elsewhere in Maryland’s portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed as long as the trade does not cause or contribute to a violation of State water quality standards.</text>
