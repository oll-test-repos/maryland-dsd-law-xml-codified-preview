The Department is authorized to use funds appropriated in the program of the annual State operating budget, which provides for general local health services for this purpose. When so used, the proportion of State, federal, and local funds, respectively, shall be that specified for each subdivision's financing of minimum health services at basic matching rates. The planning for water and sewerage facilities to be financed in this manner may be financed jointly by, or under the joint authority of, the Department and any county or Baltimore City or the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. The funds to be so used shall appear in the local health department's budget for the fiscal year in which their use is anticipated. The percentage contribution may not be affected by any other State or federal funds received by the subdivision for the same planning unless the total grants exceed the actual cost of the plan, in which case the contribution shall be reduced accordingly.</text>

      <text>Chapter Three. Chapter three shall contain a description of existing, planned, and future requirements for water service areas including tables, maps, charts, graphs, descriptive information, and all other matter regarding these systems. It shall contain a discussion of ground and surface water resources within the county including the quality and potential quantity of these sources. Summaries of existing and projected water demands and existing sources of pollution or contamination relating to water supplies shall be stated or shown. The chapter shall contain a discussion of alternatives and the rationale used in determining the means of providing future water supplies. For every water service area, the following shall be discussed or shown: operating agency, rated and actual productions, type of treatment, location, operation and maintenance costs, and proposed means of financial improvements. For any proposed new water supply source, a summary of the environmental impact of its development shall be given. Efforts to reduce demands (i.e., metering, rate changes, plumbing codes) shall be outlined. Minimum requirements for tables and maps in this chapter are as follows:</text>

It shall contain a summary of each available point of discharge evaluation, specifically those parts pertaining to protected water uses. It shall discuss the rationale for selecting a planned alternative for any proposed treatment facility, pumping station, or interceptor. For every service area and community system, the following should be discussed: operating agency, design average and peak flows; whether combined or separate collection systems; level and type of treatment given; sludge disposal plans, condition of treatment and transmission facilities; operation and maintenance costs; and proposed means of financing improvements.
