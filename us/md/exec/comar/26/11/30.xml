    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>This chapter contains all of the general requirements that apply to Portland cement manufacturing plants. New or modified cement plants may be subject to more restrictive requirements that are included in a permit issued by the Department. Portland cement manufacturing plants subject to this chapter may also be subject to federal New Source Performance Standards under 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart F, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry under 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart LLL.</text>
