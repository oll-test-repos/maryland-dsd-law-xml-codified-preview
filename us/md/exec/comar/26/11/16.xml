          <text>A person may demonstrate that emissions of a Class I or Class II TAP from a premises do not unreasonably endanger human health because of potential toxic effects other than cancer by a screening analysis showing that total allowable emissions from the premises will not cause increases in ambient levels that exceed applicable TLV-based, threshold-based, or special screening levels.</text>

          <text>If a special screening level has been adopted, a TLV-based or threshold-based screening level may not be used for that TAP. A threshold-based screening level may be used only if there is no TLV, no special screening level, and no acceptable ambient level for a TAP.</text>

        <text>For a screening analysis, a person may use the dispersion modeling procedures in Air Management Administration Technical Memorandum 86-02 (TM 86-02), "Ambient Air Quality Impact Screening Analysis for Toxic Air Pollutants", which is incorporated by reference, or other, more rigorous dispersion modeling procedures as provided in <cite path="26|11|16|.02|C.|(1)|(a)">§C(1)(a) of this regulation</cite>. If concentrations predicted using TM 86-02 exceed applicable screening levels, more rigorous modeling techniques should be used in either a screening analysis or a more detailed analysis.</text>

        <num>(4)</num>
        <text>Instead of using dispersion modeling, a person may conduct a screening analysis by showing that total allowable emissions of a TAP will be less than the most stringent applicable emission rate listed in the tables in this section. Multiple screening levels with different averaging periods may apply to a TAP. These tables may not be used with screening levels having averaging periods other than those listed in the tables. Emission rates labeled "10 Meter Stacks, No Downwash" may be used only if all emissions of the TAP are discharged from a stack or stacks at least 32.8 feet (10 meters) high under conditions preventing downwash. (TM 86-02 describes conditions causing downwash.) Except as provided in <cite path="26.11.15.06">COMAR 26.11.15.06</cite>, these emission rates apply to the total allowable emissions from a premises.</text>
