    <heading>Hazardous Wastes Which Are Exempt from Certain Regulations.</heading>
    <text>A hazardous waste which is generated in a product or raw material storage tank, a product or raw material transport vehicle or vessel, or in an associated nonwaste-treatment manufacturing unit, is not subject to regulations until it exits the unit in which it was generated, unless the unit is a surface impoundment, or unless the hazardous waste remains in the unit more than 90 days after the unit ceases to be operated for manufacturing, or for storage or transportation of products or raw material.</text>

      <text>Flame Projection Test.</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Equipment. The test equipment for the Flame Projection Test consists of a base 4 inches wide and 2 feet long. A 30-inch rule with inches marked is supported horizontally on the side of the base and about 6 inches above it. A plumber's candle of such height that the top third of the flame is at the height of the horizontal rule is placed at the zero point in the base.</text>

        <text>Procedure. The test is conducted in a draft-free area that can be ventilated and in which the atmosphere can be cleared between each test. The self-pressurized container being tested is placed at a distance of 6 inches from the ignition source and the spray is jetted into the top third of the flame with the valve opened fully for periods of 15 to 20 seconds. The length of the flame projection from the candle position is read on the horizontal scale. Three or more readings are taken on each sample and the average of the readings is taken as the result of the test. Samples are also tested with the container valve in partially open positions to test for “burning back” to the valve.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Equipment. The equipment for the open drum test and the closed drum test consists of a 55-gallon open-head steel drum or similar container that is placed on its side and fitted with a hinged cover over the open end that will open at a pressure of 5 pounds per square inch. The closed or solid end of the container is equipped with one shuttered opening at the top. The shuttered opening is for the introduction of the spray being tested. The opening is approximately 2 inches from the edge of the drum head and is 2 inches in diameter. There is a safety glass or plastic window 6 inches square in the center of the solid end. A lighted plumber's candle is placed inside the drum on the lower side and midway between the ends.</text>

          <text>Open Drum Test. This test is conducted with the hinged end of the test equipment in a completely open position and with the shutter closed. The spray from the dispenser of the item being tested, with valve opened fully, is directed into the upper half of the open end and above the ignition source for 1 minute. Any significant propagation of flame through the vapor-air mixture away from the ignition source shall be considered a positive result, except that any minor and unsustained burning in the immediate area of the ignition source is not considered a positive result.</text>

          <text>Closed Drum Test. This test is conducted with the hinged cover of the test equipment dropped into position to rest freely against the end of the equipment and to close the open end of the drum to make a seal that is reasonably secure, but not necessarily air-tight. The shutter is opened and the spray is jetted into the drum through the shutter with the valve fully opened for 1 minute. After clearing the atmosphere in the drum, the jetting is repeated similarly three times. Any explosion or rapid burning of the vapor-air mixture sufficient to cause the hinged cover to move is considered a positive result.</text>
