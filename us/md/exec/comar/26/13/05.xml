In addition to the waste analysis required by Regulation .02D, of this chapter, the owner or operator shall analyze a representative sample of waste from each incoming movement before adding the waste to any existing pile, unless the only wastes the facility receives which are amenable to piling are compatible with each other, or the waste received is compatible with the waste in the pile to which it is to be added. This analysis conducted shall be capable of differentiating between the types of hazardous waste the owner or operator places in piles, so that mixing of incompatible waste does not inadvertently occur. The analysis shall include a visual comparison of color and texture.</text>

      <text>Many hazardous wastes, when mixed with other waste or materials at a hazardous waste facility, can produce effects which are harmful to human health and environment, such as:</text>

      <text>Below are examples of potentially incompatible wastes, waste components, and materials, along with the harmful consequences which result from mixing materials in one group with materials in another group. The list is intended as a guide to owners or operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, and to enforcement and permit granting officials, to indicate the need for special precautions when managing these potentially incompatible waste materials or components.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>This list is not intended to be exhaustive. An owner or operator must, as the regulations require, adequately analyze his wastes so that he can avoid creating uncontrolled substances or reactions of the type listed below, whether they are listed below or not.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>D.</num>
      <text>It is possible for potentially incompatible wastes to be mixed in a way that precludes a reaction (e.g., adding acid to water rather than water to acid) or that neutralizes them (e.g., a strong acid mixed with a strong base), or that controls substances produced (e.g., by generating flammable gases in a closed tank equipped so that ignition cannot occur, and burning the gases in an incinerator).</text>
