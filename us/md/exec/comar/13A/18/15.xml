      <text>The Superintendent has delegated authority to administrative law judges of the Office of Administrative Hearings to make the final decisions of the Superintendent on those actions listed in <cite path="13A|18|15|.01|A.">§A of this regulation</cite>. A decision by an administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings in a family child care registration case is the final decision of the highest administrative authority in the case and thus is directly appealable to the circuit court in the jurisdiction where the child care home is located, pursuant to <cite doc="Md.
