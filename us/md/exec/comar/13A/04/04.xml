      <text>In this country, however, the public schools of the states have been limited by law or custom to so-called secular education, while freedom of religious instruction was granted to the home and various religious agencies.</text>

      <text>In accordance with this principle, the public schools of Maryland are liberally supported by all the citizens without regard to race, sect, or creed, and as a result of this policy they have reached their present state of efficiency. It appears also that this method of conducting the schools commends itself to the people of the State as a whole and is productive of satisfactory results.</text>

      <num>D.</num>
      <text>In view of these facts and conditions, and again recognizing the importance of religious training in the lives of all the citizens of the State, the State Board of Education believes it would be inexpedient to introduce the subject of religious education as a part of the school curriculum of the State.</text>
