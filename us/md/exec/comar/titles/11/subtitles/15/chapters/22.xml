      <text>Other Fees Not Waived. This proportional registration agreement does not waive any fees or taxes charged or levied by any jurisdiction in connection with the ownership or operation of vehicles other than the apportionable fees as defined in this chapter. All other fees and taxes shall be paid to each jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction.</text>
