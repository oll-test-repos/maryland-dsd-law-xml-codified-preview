    <heading>Intent.</heading>
    <text>These regulations are intended to enable the MTA to regulate and control the flow and parking of motor vehicles by transit patrons upon MTA property, including bus and rapid transit sites. Improperly parked and abandoned motor vehicles, unauthorized articles, and pieces of equipment upon MTA property constitute a public nuisance contrary to the general health, safety, and welfare of the public, deny transit patrons the right to fully use the public transit service offered and made available by the MTA and, likewise, deny MTA employees the ability to preserve and maintain the orderly control and use of MTA facilities and prevent congestion and traffic hazards.</text>
