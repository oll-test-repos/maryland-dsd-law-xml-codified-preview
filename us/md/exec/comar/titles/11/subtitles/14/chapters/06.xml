    <text>The standards, requirements, and procedures set forth in this chapter are applicable to equipment originally installed by a vehicle manufacturer or required by federal or State requirements on all vehicles designated as a 1968 or newer model year.  Each vehicle has an emissions label in the engine compartment which indicates the emissions equipment originally installed on the vehicle. If the label is not present, refer to an emissions control application guide.</text>

      <text>Most 1975 and newer passenger cars and 1975 through 1978 light-duty trucks with a manufacturer's GVW of 6,000 pounds or less were originally equipped with a catalytic converter. Some passenger cars were not originally equipped with a converter until later model years, and 1979 and newer light-duty trucks with a manufacturer's GVW of 8,501 pounds or more may not have been originally equipped with a catalytic converter.</text>

    <heading>Exhaust Gas Recirculation System (EGR).</heading>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>Most 1973 and later model vehicles are equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation system to recirculate proper amounts of exhaust gases into the air/fuel mixture in the intake manifold. This recirculation into the manifold reduces combustion temperatures, thus reducing oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  There are several types of EGR systems: a back pressure system which operates in conjunction with exhaust back pressure, a conventional system which operates on carburetor venturi vacuum, an electronically controlled system which operates from the engine computerized emissions control system, or a floor jet system which operates through jets in the floor of the intake manifold.</text>

    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>Most 1971 and newer vehicles and some older models are equipped with an evaporative emissions system to collect and store gasoline vapors and gasoline from the carburetor and fuel system during engine operation or shut down.  The vapors are collected and stored in a canister containing a charcoal filter and gasoline is returned to the fuel tank. The vapors are purged from the canister and drawn into the engine when the engine is started. A pressure vacuum gas cap is essential to the proper operation of this system.</text>
