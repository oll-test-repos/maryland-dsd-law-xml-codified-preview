A low beam headlamp shall have a minimum of 3,500 candlepower and a high beam headlamp a minimum of 5,000 candlepower. Headlamps that incorporate both high and low beam in the same assembly will be aligned on low beam.

      <text>Agency Note: Manufacturers of low speed vehicles may equip their vehicles with lamps which are not identified as approved headlamps by federal motor vehicle safety standards established for vehicles other than low speed vehicles, for example: required marking symbol of "DOT" (Department of Transportation) on headlamp lens, and any additional manufacturer's markings of headlamp type and SAE identification code. Manufacturers of low speed vehicles utilizing lighting in their vehicles as headlamps, which are not properly identified with the appropriate marking, however, are equipped with multibeam road lighting (high and low beam headlamps), will be treated as headlamps and aligned by using the Division's approved headlight testers. Lighting utilized by manufacturers of low speed vehicles as headlamps which are identified as a type lighting other than a headlamp, for example: SAE "Y", auxiliary driving lamp, or by lighting utilized as headlamps which fails to contain the appropriate headlamp marking and is not multibeam road lighting as noted above, will not be inspected and aligned by the use of the Division's approved headlight testers. These lamps will instead be visually inspected and rejected under "Non-Headlamps", inspection procedures listed below.</text>
