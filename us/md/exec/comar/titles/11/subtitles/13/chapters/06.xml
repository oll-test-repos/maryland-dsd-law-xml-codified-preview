    <text>Speedometers and odometers, when inspected, shall have legible dials and calibrations and register speed and distance traveled in miles or kilometers, or both, and be connected and operable. When the odometer is calibrated only in kilometers, a written notice shall be posted on the instrument panel in full view of the driver, and the notice shall contain the formula for converting kilometers to miles. Example: “Kilometers” divided by 1.609 equals “miles”.</text>

    <heading>Service, Repair, or Replacement of an Odometer.</heading>
    <text>Nothing in this title prevents the service, repair, or replacement of an odometer, whether calibrated in miles or kilometers, provided the distance traveled that is indicated on the odometer remains the same as before the service, repair, or replacement. If the odometer is incapable of registering the same distance traveled before the service, repair, or replacement, the odometer shall be adjusted to read zero, and a notice in writing shall be attached to the left door frame of the vehicle by the owner, his agent, or the person performing the service, repair, or replacement specifying the distance traveled before repair or replacement of the odometer and the date on which it was repaired or replaced. Any removal or alteration of the notice shall be a violation of this regulation.</text>
