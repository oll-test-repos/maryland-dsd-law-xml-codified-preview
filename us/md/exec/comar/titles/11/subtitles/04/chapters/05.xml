      <text>Authority. The Annotated Code of Maryland grants to the Administration certain regulatory authority, including the right to limit the width and location of existing access points, the requirement that a temporary or permanent entrance from any commercial or industrial property may not be made into any highway except in accordance with a permit issued by the Administration, and the requirement that permits must be acquired from the Administration before working within and across a State highway. An application for a permit to construct a commercial entrance street intersection shall be filed with plans, performance surety, and any other items which may be required by the responsible parties or their authorized representative.</text>

      <text>The gradients of intersecting streets should be as flat as possible on those sections that are to be used for storage space for stopped vehicles. Grades in excess of 2 percent may not be allowed on the landing grade (first 50 feet) of intersecting streets, unless otherwise approved by the Administration. This allows for a normal maximum grade break of 5 percent between the normal 2 percent preference road cross slope and the profile grade of the nonpreference road. Grades beyond the landing grade shall be in accordance with currently accepted engineering practices, but may not exceed 6 percent. In all cases, appropriate cross slopes provide a maximum 2 percent cross slope for pedestrian mobility in a manner acceptable to the Administration.</text>

Acceptable outfalls, and their associated contributing drainage facilities, shall meet the design criteria set forth by the Administration.

In cases where the proposed site storm drainage facilities:</text>

        <text>Are not tied into existing highway drainage facilities, storm water management plans should be reviewed and approved by a county, a soil conservation district, or the State Water Resources Administration, or all of these. The discharge rate after development may not exceed the rate before development for the 2-, 10-, and, in some instances, the 100-year storm events. The State Highway Administration will institute legal proceedings upon being damaged by increased storm water runoff to recover any costs and to avoid recurrence.</text>

For example, State highway cross culvert outfalls will be analyzed using the functional classification storm, State side ditch outfalls on the 10-year storm, State longitudinal storm drain outfalls on the 25-year storm, etc.</text>
