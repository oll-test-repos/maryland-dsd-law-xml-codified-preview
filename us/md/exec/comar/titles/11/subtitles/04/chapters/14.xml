      <text>On any approach to a traffic signal where a traffic control monitoring system is in use, the agency shall ensure that the yellow change interval on that approach is not shorter in duration than that determined by the formula set forth in <cite path="11|04|14|.03|B.">§B of this regulation</cite>, following any adjustments required by <cite path="11|04|14|.03|C.">§C of this regulation</cite>.</text>

      <text>Y = yellow change interval (in seconds);</text>
