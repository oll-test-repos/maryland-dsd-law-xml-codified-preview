Thereupon, notwithstanding any provisions of the instrument, the seller shall be obligated to refund to the buyer, within 10 days after notice of the cancellation, an amount equal to at least 90 percent of all payments made by the buyer under the instrument, including any down payment. If the seller has placed an order for special optional equipment, paint, or similar items, or if, at the request of the buyer, the dealer has modified a vehicle which he has in stock, and the vehicle sales contract has been properly signed by all parties attesting to this fact, if the buyer subsequently cancels the contract before delivery or tender of the vehicle, the seller shall refund the down payment within 10 days after notice of the cancellation, less reasonable expenses incurred in the ordering of or the modification of the vehicle. The contract shall clearly disclose that the dealer may retain a portion of the deposit or down payment to cover any reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the cancellation of the contract. When a portion of the down payment or deposit is retained by the seller, the seller shall furnish the buyer with an itemized list reflecting all expenses incurred as a result of the cancellation of the contract.
