    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The Ignition Interlock System Program established by the Administration under <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gtr|16-404">Transportation Article, §16-404</cite>.1, Annotated Code of Maryland, requires certain individuals who are convicted of a certain offense under certain circumstances to participate in the Program, requires certain individuals to participate in the Program as a condition of modification of a license suspension or revocation, and allows certain individuals with an alcohol-related driving offense or conviction to participate in the Program as a condition of continued licensure. The purpose of this chapter is to establish the eligibility requirements for participation in the Program, to monitor the participants, and to define the administrative action to be taken if a participant violates the conditions or requirements of the Program.</text>
