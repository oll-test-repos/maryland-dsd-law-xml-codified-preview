EPA periodically updates the schedule of user fees and publishes the updated fee schedule to ensure that the e-manifest user community is aware of the revisions, as provided in 40 CFR §264.1313. An owner or operator subject to these user fees is required by EPA to make user fee payments in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR §264.1314, subject to the informal fee dispute resolution process of 40 CFR §264.1316, and subject to the sanctions for delinquent payments under 40 CFR §264.1315.</aftertext>

      <text>Below are examples of potentially incompatible wastes, waste components, and materials, along with the harmful consequences which result from mixing materials in one group with materials in another group. The list is intended as a guide to owners or operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, and to enforcement and permit granting officials, to indicate the need for special precautions when managing these potentially incompatible waste materials or components.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>This list is not intended to be exhaustive. An owner or operator must, as the regulations require, adequately analyze his wastes so that he can avoid creating uncontrolled substances or reactions of the type listed below, whether they are listed below or not.</text>

      <num>D.</num>
      <text>It is possible for potentially incompatible wastes to be mixed in a way that precludes a reaction (e.g., adding acid to water rather than water to acid) or that neutralizes them (e.g., a strong acid mixed with a strong base), or that controls substances produced (e.g., by generating flammable gases in a closed tank equipped so that ignition cannot occur, and burning the gases in an incinerator).</text>
