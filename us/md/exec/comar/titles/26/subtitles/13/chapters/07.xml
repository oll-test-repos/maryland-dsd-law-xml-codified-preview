      <text>Completeness. The Secretary may not issue a permit before receiving a complete application for a permit. An application for a permit under a program is complete when the Secretary receives an application form, and any supplemental information, which is completed to the Secretary's satisfaction.

The Secretary shall judge the completeness of any application for a permit independently of the status of any other permit application or permit for the same facility or activity.

If cause exists, the Secretary may modify or revoke and reissue the permit accordingly, subject to the limitations of §B, of this regulation, and may request an updated application if necessary. When a permit is modified, only the conditions subject to modification are reopened. If a permit is revoked and reissued, the entire permit is reopened and subject to revision and the permit is reissued for a new term.
