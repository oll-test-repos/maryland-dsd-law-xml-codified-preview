        <text>Procedure. The test is conducted in a draft-free area that can be ventilated and in which the atmosphere can be cleared between each test. The self-pressurized container being tested is placed at a distance of 6 inches from the ignition source and the spray is jetted into the top third of the flame with the valve opened fully for periods of 15 to 20 seconds. The length of the flame projection from the candle position is read on the horizontal scale. Three or more readings are taken on each sample and the average of the readings is taken as the result of the test. Samples are also tested with the container valve in partially open positions to test for "burning back" to the valve.</text>

The opening is approximately 2 inches from the edge of the drum head and is 2 inches in diameter. There is a safety glass or plastic window 6 inches square in the center of the solid end.

Any significant propagation of flame through the vapor-air mixture away from the ignition source shall be considered a positive result, except that any minor and unsustained burning in the immediate area of the ignition source is not considered a positive result.</text>

The shutter is opened and the spray is jetted into the drum through the shutter with the valve fully opened for 1 minute. After clearing the atmosphere in the drum, the jetting is repeated similarly three times. Any explosion or rapid burning of the vapor-air mixture sufficient to cause the hinged cover to move is considered a positive result.</text>

When the waste contains less than 0.5 percent filterable solids, the waste itself, after filtering using the methodology outlined in Test Method 1311, is considered to be the extract for the purpose of this section.</text>
