  <heading>Control of Noise Pollution</heading>
  <text class="center">Preface</text>
  <text>The Environmental Noise Act of 1974 of the State of Maryland declares as policy the limitation of noise to that level which will protect the health, general welfare, and property of the people of the State. It requires that the Department assume responsibility to prepare regulations for the control of noise, including the establishment of standards for ambient noise levels and equipment performance with respect to noise, for adoption by the Secretary of the Environment. It allows political subdivisions to adopt environmental noise standards. Enforcement of the regulations and standards is the responsibility of political subdivisions in all areas.</text>

        <text>"Equivalent sound level" (also "average sound level") means the level of a constant sound which, in a given situation and time period, would convey the same sound energy as does the actual time-varying sound during the same period. Equivalent sound level is the level of the time weighted, mean-square, A-weighted sound pressure. A numerical subscript may be used to indicate the time period under consideration; i.e., L<sub>eq</sub>24 or L<sub>eq</sub>8 for 24-hour and 8-hour periods, respectively. No subscript indicates a 24-hour period. The mathematical expression for the L<sub>eq</sub> is as follows:</text>

        <text>It is known that noise above certain levels is harmful to the health of humans. Although precise levels at which all adverse health effects occur have not definitely been ascertained, it is known that one's well-being can be affected by noise through loss of sleep, speech interference, hearing impairment, and a variety of other psychological and physiological factors. The establishment of ambient noise standards, or goals, must provide margins of safety in reaching conclusions based on available data which relate noise exposure to health and welfare effects, with due consideration to technical and economic factors.</text>
