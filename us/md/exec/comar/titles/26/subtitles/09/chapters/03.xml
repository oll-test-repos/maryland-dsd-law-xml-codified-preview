    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The Department shall provide for the award of CO<sub>2</sub> offset allowances to project sponsors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions offset projects that have demonstrated a reduction or avoidance of atmospheric loading of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, or sequestered carbon. These requirements ensure that the awarded CO<sub>2</sub> offset allowances represent real, additional, verifiable, enforceable, and permanent CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emission reductions or carbon sequestration. Subject to the relevant compliance deduction limitations identified in <cite path="26.09.02.03|K.">COMAR 26.09.02.03K</cite>, CO<sub>2</sub> offset allowances may be used by any CO<sub>2</sub> budget source for compliance purposes.</text>
