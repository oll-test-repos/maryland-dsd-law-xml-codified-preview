    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>Any developer or subdivider contemplating the subdivision of land, before preparation of a preliminary plan, may request a review by the Approving Authority and other agencies having jurisdiction to secure information concerning general requirements in the area in which the proposed subdivision is to be located. If individual water supply or individual sewerage systems are contemplated, rejection or tentative approval may be secured at this time by submitting a boundary plat of the proposed subdivision and by drilling test wells and performing soil percolation tests on the entire tract in the numbers and at the locations as the Approving Authority may require, but not less than one percolation test per acre. The soil percolation tests should be performed only at the time of year when the highest water table can be expected as indicated for a given area by the soil survey. The results of the percolation tests shall be considered along with available data on the general topography, soil classifications, surface and subsurface drainage conditions, elevation of the water table, the history of failures of sewerage systems and individual water supplies in adjacent areas, and the extent of sewerage systems and individual water supply development in the adjacent area. The development of a subdivision may not be considered where, in the opinion of the Approving Authority, the infiltration of individual sewerage system wastes may result in the contamination of the ground water.</text>

      <num>B.</num>
      <text>Application for approval of a subdivision shall include a preliminary plan and any other forms required by the Approving Authority. These forms shall include a description of the methods proposed for providing water supply and sewage disposal. Where individual water supply or sewerage systems are contemplated, the Approving Authority shall require at least one percolation test on each lot at the approximate disposal site, and any other tests as may be required, to be conducted under the supervision of the Approving Authority, with the resultant data becoming part of the application. The soil percolation test sites will be shown on the preliminary plan.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>In those areas where the soil survey indicates moderate or severe restriction due to seasonal high water tables, the percolation tests shall be performed at the time of year when the highest water table can be expected as indicated for a given area by the soil survey. The tests shall be performed at such elevation as to leave undisturbed soil for the underground sewage disposal area after grading is completed. The Approving Authority shall consider the general topography of the area, soil classifications, surface and subsurface drainage conditions, elevation of the ground water table, the history of failures of sewerage systems, and well water supply development in the adjacent area.</text>

Topography shall be shown on 2-foot contours, provided, however, that if ground slope is sufficiently steep for 5-foot contours to show the surface configuration, the Approving Authority may permit use of the larger contour interval. Smaller contour intervals may be required where 2-foot contours do not indicate existing surface conditions. A general site location map shall be included with the preliminary plan for reference identification of the area. At least two white prints of the preliminary plan shall be submitted to the Approving Authority.</text>

The Approving Authority shall require of the owner any assurance he deems necessary that the facilities will be maintained and operated so as to provide for a continuous and acceptable water supply or sewage disposal service to the properties served.</text>
