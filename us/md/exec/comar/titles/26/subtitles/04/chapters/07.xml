      <text>Hydrogeologic Siting Criteria.

Compatibility criteria shall include, but are not limited to the following:</text>

      <text>Closure Cap. The closure cap shall be designed to minimize infiltration into the landfill and shall be developed through an engineering analysis of the site.

Elements of the closure cap may also be constructed of a synthetic or manufactured membrane material.</text>

        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>A low permeability cap shall be emplaced over the final cover. The cap material may consist of synthetic material with a minimum thickness of 20 mil and a maximum permeability of 1 × 10<sup>-10th</sup> centimeters/second, or a minimum of 1 foot of clay or other natural fine-grained material having an in-place permeability less than or equal to 1 × 10<sup>-5th</sup> centimeters/second. The cap shall be installed with a minimum slope of 4 percent to facilitate drainage of percolate.</text>

        <text>A drainage layer with a minimum thickness of 6 inches shall be emplaced immediately above the low permeability cap. Acceptable drainage layer material shall include clean sand or other natural coarse grained material with an in-place permeability greater than 1 × 10<sup>-3rd</sup> centimeters/second. The drainage layer shall be free of materials which may puncture or otherwise jeopardize the integrity of the low permeability cap. Commercially available filter fabrics, when used in conjunction with synthetic drainage blankets, may serve instead of the fine material, provided that the Department reviews and approves the selected materials and design configuration.</text>

        <text>Vegetative Stabilization. Within 30 days after the final earthen cover has been installed, the area shall be vegetatively stabilized using a perennial cover species as recommended by the county soil conservation district. Sufficient lime and commercial fertilizer, or sewage sludge as authorized by a permit issued under <cite path="|26.04.06">COMAR 26.04.06</cite>, shall be applied to the site to sustain vegetative growth. If the final cover is installed at a time which precludes seeding, the site shall be tacked and mulched in accordance with accepted sediment and erosion control specifications until the next available seeding window, at which time the site shall be vegetatively stabilized.</text>
