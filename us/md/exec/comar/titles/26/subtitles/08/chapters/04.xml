      <text>General. Biologically available equivalence addresses the potential for an effluent constituent, present primarily in the particulate or relatively non-bioavailable form, to become transformed by mixing with the receiving water to a bioavailable form. The biological translator utilizes the relationship between effluent-receiving water toxicity testing results and the laboratory standard dilution water toxicity data to relate an instream aquatic life criterion to the impact of a specific effluent. This ratio provides discharge-specific information concerning the assimilative capacity of the surface water for a specific pollutant when contained in a particular discharge.</text>
