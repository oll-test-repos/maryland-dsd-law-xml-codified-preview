    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of these regulations is to provide a procedure by which the Department of the Environment may certify that water quality laboratories are capable of performing in an acceptable manner microbiological, chemical, physical, and radiochemical analyses on water samples from public water supplies. Since owners of public water supplies are required through various State and federal programs to monitor the quality of drinking water in their systems, it is necessary to have available water quality laboratories that produce data recognized as valid by the enforcement agencies. These regulations establish standards of operation for these water quality laboratories.</text>
