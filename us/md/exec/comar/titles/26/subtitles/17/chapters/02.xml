      <text>The primary goals of the State and local stormwater management programs are to maintain after development, as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics, and to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation and sedimentation, and local flooding by implementing environmental site design to the maximum extent practicable and using appropriate structural best management practices only when necessary.</text>
