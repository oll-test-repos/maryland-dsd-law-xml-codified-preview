    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>These regulations are designed to govern construction, reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a dam, reservoir, or waterway obstruction or any change of the course, current, or cross section of a stream or body of water within the State including any changes to the 100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing waters. Free-flowing waters do not include State or private wetlands or areas subject to tidal flooding. For purposes of these regulations, the landward boundaries of any tidal waters shall be deemed coterminous with the wetlands boundary maps adopted pursuant to <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gen|16-301">Environment Article, §16-301, Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>.</text>

        <text>Classification of Dams. The following table sets forth judgmental factors for minimizing the risk associated with the design of dams. The table is intended only as a guide. A proposed dam shall satisfy all four factors (normal pool storage volume, normal depth, potential for loss of life, and potential for damage) in order to avoid classification in a more rigorous category. Failure damage potential shall consider future development and use of the area flooded throughout the danger reach and the damage which would be expected from a complete breaching of the dam. If, in the opinion of the Administration, future development is probable in the area flooded throughout the danger reach, the dam shall be classed in Category I. The classification of the proposed dam shall be assigned by the Administration after the applicant has provided information on the potential damage within the danger reach, as defined herein. After the classification has been assigned, the inflow design flood and spillway design may be established. Dams qualifying for the Category III classification may be classed in Category IV, if all of the requirements of <cite doc="Md.

      <text>The criteria described herein are presented to assist persons in preparing their permit applications and to provide a consistent basis for the Administration's decisions. The Administration shall follow the criteria, unless the Administration determines that the overall public interest requires a variance. In that case, written documentation justifying the variance shall have been submitted by the applicant and will be approved in writing by the Administration, for inclusion in the record. As the basis for approval, denial, or modification of a permit, the Administration shall weigh all public advantages and disadvantages. The administration shall grant the permit, if approval of the project is in the best public interest and the plans for the project provide for the greatest feasible utilization of the waters of the State, adequately preserve the public safety, and promote the general public welfare. The criteria described in Sec. B of this regulation shall apply to all applications. Depending on the purpose of the proposed project, additional specific criteria, as described in subsequent sections, shall also apply.</text>

Construction of an impoundment upon a scenic or wild river is contrary to the public interest, if that project floods an area of unusual beauty, blocks the access to the public of a view previously enjoyed, or alters the stream's wild qualities.</text>
