    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>This chapter requires public and nonpublic schools to test their drinking water outlets for lead contamination and establishes an ongoing program to minimize the risk of exposure to lead in the school’s drinking water and establishes an action level of 20 parts per billion (ppb) for lead in drinking water in school buildings.</text>

    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>This chapter establishes requirements and standards for lead monitoring in occupied public and nonpublic school buildings serving prekindergarten through grade 12 students where drinking water to the building is provided by a public water system. This chapter does not apply to a public or nonpublic school that is regulated as a public water system in accordance with the requirements of <cite path="|26.04.01">COMAR 26.04.01</cite>.</text>
