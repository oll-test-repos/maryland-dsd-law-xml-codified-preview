The suggested point for measuring the flow rate of recovered solvent is from the solvent-water separator. Near the end of the recovery cycle, the flow of recovered solvent should be diverted to a graduated cylinder. The cycle should continue until the maximum flow of solvent is 50 milliliters per minute. The type of articles cleaned and the total length of the cycle shall then be recorded.
