      <text>"Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)" means a standardized reporting system for advising the public of possible adverse health effects due to air pollution. PSI is a reporting tool that converts measured air pollutant concentrations to a simple number on a scale of 0 to 500. A level of 100 on the PSI scale corresponds to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or particulate matter. Only the highest PSI is reported for any one period. The levels between 0 and 100 correspond to a percentage of the standard, while the levels between 100 and 500 are uniform intervals between the National Ambient Air Quality Standard and the "significant harm level", as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</text>
