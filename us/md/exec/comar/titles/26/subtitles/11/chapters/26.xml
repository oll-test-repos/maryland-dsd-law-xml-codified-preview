    <text>The purpose of this chapter is to implement §176(c)(4)(E) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended (42 U.S.C. §7401 et seq.), and the related requirements of 23 U.S.C. §109(j), with respect to the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects which are developed, funded, or approved by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), and by metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) or other recipients of funds under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Laws (49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). This chapter sets forth policy, criteria, and procedures for demonstrating and assuring conformity of these activities to an applicable implementation plan developed pursuant to §110 and Part D of the CAA. The requirements in this chapter are applicable in areas of the State designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as nonattainment or maintenance areas for any relevant National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).</text>
