    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>This chapter codifies the quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures previously established by the Department’s Technical Memorandum 90-01 for continuous opacity monitors (COMs). The procedures are transferred into this chapter in regulatory format. In addition, the general provisions and quality control requirements found in <cite path="26.11.01.10">COMAR 26.11.01.10</cite> are also applicable to COMs.</text>
