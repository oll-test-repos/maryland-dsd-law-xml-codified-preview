    <heading>General Policy.</heading>
    <text>When mining is not otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation, all open-pit mining operations on land owned by the State, whether or not the ownership includes mineral rights incident to the land, shall comply with the requirements of this subtitle. This includes provisions relating to permit applications, bonding and insurance, as well as all performance and reclamation standards. In addition, the following regulations set out special requirements applicable to open-pit mining and reclamation operations on land owned by the State. Open-pit mining on State-owned land is permitted only:</text>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>To the extent that it will directly promote the proper reclamation of abandoned surface or deep mines; or</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>In the case of public construction activities, to the extent that mining will accomplish the construction project or avoid, eliminate, or reduce adverse environmental impacts and hazardous conditions associated with construction projects such as water pollution, subsidence, and landslides.</text>

      <text>Applicants for permits to mine on State-owned land shall comply with the permit application requirements of this subtitle as specified in <cite path="|26.20.02">COMAR 26.20.02</cite> and, if applicable, <cite path="|26.20.03">COMAR 26.20.03</cite>. The Bureau of Mines shall process the application as provided by <cite path="|26.20.04">COMAR 26.20.04</cite> except that the Bureau shall also forward a copy of the application to the agency responsible for management of the area to be affected by mining. The copy of the application that is sent to the management agency shall be instead of any notification that would otherwise be sent to that agency under <cite path="|26.20.04">COMAR 26.20.04</cite>. The management agency shall evaluate the application and prepare an analysis of the impact of the proposed mining on the current and future use of the area and on State policies and objectives applicable to the area. The management agency shall forward its recommendations to the Bureau.</text>
