          <text>"Government-financed construction" means construction funded 50 percent or more by funds appropriated from a government financing agency's budget or obtained from general revenue bonds. Funding at less than 50 percent may qualify if the construction is undertaken as an approved reclamation project under <cite doc="Md.

        <text>"Extraction of coal incidental to government-financed construction" means the extraction of coal which is necessary to enable the construction to be accomplished. Only that coal extracted from within the right-of-way, in the case of a road, railroad, utility line, or other similar constructions, or within the boundaries of the area directly affected by other types of government-financed construction, may be considered incidental to that construction. Extraction of coal outside the right-of-way or boundary of the area directly affected by the construction is subject to the requirements of the Regulatory Program.</text>
