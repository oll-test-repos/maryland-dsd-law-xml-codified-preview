        <text>"Fragile lands" means geographic areas containing natural, ecologic, scientific, or esthetic resources that could be damaged or destroyed by surface coal mining operations. Examples of fragile lands include valuable habitats for fish or wildlife, critical habitats for endangered or threatened species of animals or plants, uncommon geologic formations, National Natural Landmark sites, areas where mining may cause flooding, environmental corridors containing a concentration of ecologic and esthetic features, areas of recreational value due to high environmental quality, and buffer zones adjacent to the boundaries of areas where surface coal mining operations are prohibited under <cite path="|26.20.10">COMAR 26.20.10</cite>.</text>

        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>"Historic lands" means historic or cultural districts, places, structures, or objects, including archeological and paleontological sites, National Historic Landmark sites, sites listed on or eligible for listing on a State or national register of historic places, sites having religious or cultural significance to Native Americans or religious groups or sites for which historic designation is pending.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>"Natural hazard lands" means geographic areas in which natural conditions exist that pose or, as a result of surface coal mining operations, may pose, a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of people, property, or the environment, including areas subject to landslides, cave-ins, severe wind or soil erosion, frequent flooding, avalanches, and areas of unstable geology.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(4)</num>
        <text>"Substantial legal and financial commitments in a surface coal mining operation" means significant investments that have been made on the basis of a long-term coal contract in power plants, railroads, coal-handling, preparation, extraction or storage facilities, and other capital-intensive activities. An example would be an existing mine, not actually producing coal, but in a substantial stage of development before production. Costs of acquiring the coal in place or of the right to mine it without an existing mine, as described in the above example, alone are not sufficient to constitute substantial legal and financial commitments.</text>
