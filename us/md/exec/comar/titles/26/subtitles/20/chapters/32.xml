      <text>Civil penalties may be as much as $5,000 for each violation of the Regulatory Program. Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessments.</text>

      <text>If a person fails to correct a violation within the time specified in either a notice of violation or cessation order, the Bureau shall assess a civil penalty of not less than $750 for each day up to 30 days beyond the compliance deadline during which the violation continues, and may assess this penalty beyond that time for continued noncompliance.

      <text>Whenever the $750 per day penalty of <cite path="26|20|32|.01|D.">§D of this regulation</cite> is not assessed beyond 30 days, the Bureau shall take appropriate action pursuant to the Regulatory Program, within 30 days, to ensure that abatement occurs or to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of the failure to abate.</text>
