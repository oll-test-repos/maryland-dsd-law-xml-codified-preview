        <text>Topsoil to be saved shall be removed after vegetation that could interfere with the use of the topsoil is cleared from the areas to be disturbed, but before any drilling, blasting, mining, or other surface disturbance.</text>

        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>All topsoil shall be removed in a separate layer from the areas to be disturbed, unless use of substitute or supplemental materials is approved by the Bureau. If the topsoil is less than 6 inches, a separate layer shall be removed that includes all of the topsoil and the unconsolidated materials immediately below the topsoil to a minimum depth of 6 inches.</text>

        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>If the Bureau determines that it is necessary or desirable, to ensure soil productivity consistent with the post-mining land use, then the Bureau may require removal of an additional layer (including portions of the "B" or "C" horizons) to be segregated and redistributed as subsoil.</text>

        <num>(5)</num>
        <text>Selected overburden materials may be substituted for, or used as a supplement to, topsoil if the Bureau determines that the resulting soil medium is equal to or more suitable for sustaining revegetation than is the available topsoil and if the substitute material is the best available to support revegetation. This determination shall be based on analysis of the thickness of soil horizons, total depth, texture, percent coarse fragments, pH, and areal extent of the different kinds of soils. The Bureau may require other chemical and physical analyses, field-site trials, or greenhouse tests, if determined to be necessary or desirable to demonstrate the suitability of topsoil substitutes or supplements.</text>
