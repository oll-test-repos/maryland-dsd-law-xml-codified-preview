      <text>The requirements of this regulation apply to any person who conducts or intends to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations under a permit authorizing the use of alternative mining practices on an experimental basis, if the practices require a variance from the environmental protection performance standards of the Regulatory Program. The purpose of this regulation is to provide requirements for the permitting of surface coal mining and reclamation operations that encourage advances in mining and reclamation practices, or allow postmining land use for industrial, commercial, residential, or public use (including recreational facilities) on an experimental basis. "Experimental practice" means the use of alternative surface coal mining and reclamation operation practices for experimental or research purposes. Experimental practices need not comply with specific environmental protection performance standards of the Regulatory Program, if approved pursuant to this regulation.</text>
