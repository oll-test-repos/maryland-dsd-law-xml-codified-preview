    <text>The regulations in this subtitle contain requirements applicable to all surface mining of coal in the State, and the surface effects of deep mining of coal. The regulations are promulgated in accordance with the Maryland Strip Mining Program pursuant to the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-87). Regulations become effective on the date of approval of the Maryland program by the Federal Office of Surface Mining or such later date as specified in the order of the Circuit Court for Allegany County in No. 35343, Equity.</text>
