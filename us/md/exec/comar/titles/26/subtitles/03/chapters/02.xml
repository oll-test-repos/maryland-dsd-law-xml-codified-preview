    <heading>Purification of Water and the Treatment of Sewerage.</heading>
    <text>The Secretary of the Environment has no hard and fast rules relating to the purification of water supplies, nor has he deemed it wise to establish written standards of purity for streams or other bodies of water into which sewage shall discharge. Conditions are very different in various sections of the State, and also even in neighboring districts. Each water supply and each sewerage system presents a separate problem which shall be solved in a satisfactory manner to conform with the surrounding conditions.</text>
