      <text>Wastewater Fund: Bay Restoration Fund fees collected from customers or users of wastewater treatment plants are deposited by the Comptroller into this fund and are used to provide grants for the upgrade of wastewater treatment plants with enhanced nutrient removal technology, a portion of the operation and maintenance costs related to ENR, and other authorized uses.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>Onsite Sewage Disposal System Fund: Bay Restoration Fund fees collected from users of onsite sewage disposal systems (such as septic systems or holding tanks) are deposited by the Comptroller into this fund and are used to provide grants or loans for the upgrade of onsite sewage disposal systems with best available technology for removal of nitrogen, and other authorized uses.</text>
