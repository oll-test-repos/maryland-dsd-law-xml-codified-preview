      <text>This chapter applies to hearings concerning actions taken by the Office of Child Care which adversely impact family child care registrations, such as registration denials, revocations, and suspensions, reductions in capacity, limitations on the ages or numbers of children who may be admitted to a family child care home, limitations on the spaces, rooms, or areas that may be used for child care, restrictions on which individuals can be alone with children in care pending open child protective services or criminal investigations, and the imposition of civil penalties for providing or advertising unregistered family child care services without a valid family child care certificate of registration.</text>

      <text>The Superintendent has delegated authority to administrative law judges of the Office of Administrative Hearings to make the final decisions of the Superintendent on those actions listed in <cite path="13A|15|14|.01|A.">§A of this regulation</cite>. A decision by an administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings in a family child care registration case is the final decision of the highest administrative authority in the case and thus is directly appealable to the circuit court in the jurisdiction where the family child care home is located, pursuant to <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gsg|10-222">State Government Article, §10-222, Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>.</text>
