      <text>If a year-end report is not filed within 30 days of the original due date of the report, the Department may make a withdrawal from the reserve account on the basis of the Department's determination from an inspection of the lender's files that, for the immediately preceding 12-month period ending on June 30, the balance in the reserve account continuously exceeded 100 percent of the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans, including unfunded portions of enrolled loans that are lines of credit. If the lender fails or refuses to make all or any part of its files available to the Department for inspection for this purpose, the Department may make a withdrawal from the reserve account on the basis of the Department's determination from a review of the Department's own records that, for the immediately preceding 12-month period ending on June 30, the balance in the reserve account continuously exceeded 100 percent of the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans, including unfunded portions of enrolled loans that are lines of credit. The amount of the withdrawal may not be greater than the minimum amount of any excess as continuously maintained over the immediately preceding 12-month period ending on June 30. Withdrawals of excess sums by the Department under this section may be used for any purpose.</text>

    <heading>Termination of Obligation to Lender.</heading>
    <text>The Department may terminate the obligation to a lender to enroll loans under the Program if the Department determines that the lender is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Program or the requirements of this chapter. The termination takes effect on the date specified in the notice of termination, except that the termination does not apply to a loan made on or before the date on which the notice of termination is received by the lender. If the Department is terminating the enrollment of loans for all participating lenders under the Program, the Department shall provide at least 90 days notice to the lender. A termination under this regulation is prospective only and does not apply to a loan previously refinanced. After termination, the amount covered under the Program may not be increased beyond the covered amount as previously enrolled.</text>
