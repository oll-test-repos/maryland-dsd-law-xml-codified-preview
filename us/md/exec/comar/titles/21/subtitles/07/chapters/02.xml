      <text>"(1) The procurement officer unilaterally may, at any time, without notice to the sureties, if any, by written order designated or indicated to be a change order, make any change in the work within the general scope of the contract, including but not limited to changes:</text>

      <aftertext>"(2) Any other written order or an oral order, including a direction, instruction, interpretation or determination, from the procurement officer that causes any such change, shall be treated as a change order under this clause, provided that the Contractor gives the procurement officer written notice stating the date, circumstances, and source of the order and that the Contractor regards the order as a change order.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(3) Except as herein provided, no order, statement, or conduct of the procurement officer shall be treated as a change under this clause or entitle the Contractor to an equitable adjustment hereunder.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(4) Subject to paragraph (6)of this clause, if any change under this clause causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by any order, an equitable adjustment shall be made and the contract modified in writing accordingly; provided, however, that except for claims based on defective specifications, no claim for any change under paragraph (2) of this clause, shall be allowed for any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor gives written notice as therein required; and provided further, that in the case of defective specifications for which the State is responsible, the equitable adjustment shall include any increased cost reasonably incurred by the Contractor in attempting to comply with such defective specifications.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(5) If the Contractor intends to assert a claim for an equitable adjustment under this clause, the Contractor shall, within 30 days after receipt of a written change order under paragraph(1) of this clause, or the furnishing of written notice under paragraph (2) of this clause, submit to the procurement officer a written statement setting forth the general nature and monetary extent of such claim, unless this period is extended by the State. The statement of claim hereunder may be included in the notice under paragraph (2) of this clause.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(6) Each contract modification or change order that affects contract price shall be subject to the prior written approval of the procurement officer and other appropriate authorities and to prior certification of the appropriate fiscal authority of fund availability and the effect of the modification or change order on the project budget or the total construction cost. If, according to the certification of the fiscal authority, the contract modification or change order will cause an increase in cost that will exceed budgeted and available funds, the modification or change order may not be made unless sufficient additional funds are made available or the scope of the project is adjusted to permit its completion within the project budget.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(7) No claim by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment hereunder shall be allowed if asserted after final payment under this contract."</aftertext>

If the quantity variation is such as to cause an increase in the time necessary for completion, the procurement officer shall, upon receipt of a written request for an extension of time within ten (10) days from the beginning of the delay, or within a further period of time which may be granted by the procurement officer before the date of final settlement of the contract, ascertain the facts and make the adjustment for extending the completion date as in the procurement officer’s judgment the findings justify."</text>

    <text>Mandatory provision for all construction contracts:</text>

      <text>"Suspension of Work</text>
      <text>"(1) The procurement officer unilaterally may order the Contractor in writing to suspend, delay, or interrupt all or any part of the work for a period of time as the procurement officer may determine to be appropriate for the convenience of the State.</text>
      <text>"(2) If the performance of all or any part of the work is for an unreasonable period of time, suspended, delayed, or interrupted by an act of the procurement officer in the administration of this contract, or by the procurement officer’s failure to act within the time specified in this contract (or if no time is specified, within a reasonable time), an adjustment shall be made for any increase in the cost of performance of this contract (excluding profit) necessarily caused by an unreasonable suspension, delay, or interruption and the contract modified in writing accordingly. However, no adjustment shall be made under this clause for any suspension, delay, or interruption to the extent(1) that performance would have been so suspended, delayed, or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor or (2) for which an equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under any provision of this contract.</text>
      <text>"(3) No claim under this clause shall be allowed(1) for any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the procurement officer in writing of the act or failure to act involved (but this requirement shall not apply as to a claim resulting from a suspension order), and (2) unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the termination of a suspension, delay, or interruption, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract."</text>

The procurement officer shall promptly investigate the conditions, and if the procurement officer finds that such conditions do materially so differ and cause an increase or decrease in the Contractor’s cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed as a result of such conditions, an equitable adjustment shall be made and the contract modified in writing accordingly.</text>

    <heading>Disputes.</heading>
    <text>Mandatory provision for all construction contracts:</text>
    <include>
      <text>"A. This contract is subject to the provisions of <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gsf">State Finance and Procurement Article, Title 15, Subtitle 2, Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>, and <cite path="|21.10">COMAR 21.10</cite>.</text>
      <text>"B. Except as otherwise provided in this contract or by law, all disputes arising under or as a result of a breach of this contract that are not disposed of by mutual agreement shall be resolved in accordance with this clause.</text>
      <text>"C. As used herein, claim means a written demand or assertion by one of the parties seeking, as a legal right, the payment of money, adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief, arising under or relating to this contract. A voucher, invoice, or request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under this clause. However, if the submission subsequently is not acted upon in a reasonable time, or is disputed as to liability or amount, it may be converted to a claim for the purpose of this clause.</text>
      <text>"D. Within 30 days after contractor knows or should have known of the basis for a claim relating to this contract, contractor shall file a written notice of claim with the procurement officer.</text>
      <text>"E. Contemporaneously with, or within 90 days after, the filing of a notice of claim, contractor shall submit the written claim to the procurement officer. If contractor so requests, the procurement officer, on conditions the procurement officer deems satisfactory to the unit, may extend the time in which contractor must submit the claim. An example of when a procurement officer may grant an extension includes situations in which the procurement officer finds that a contemporaneous or timely cost quantification following the filing of the notice of claim is impossible or impractical.</text>
      <text>"F. The claim shall set forth all the facts surrounding the controversy. Contractor, at the discretion of the procurement officer, may be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of the claim.</text>
      <text>"G. The procurement officer shall mail or deliver written notification of the final decision within:</text>
      <text>"(1) 90 days after the procurement officer receives the claim if the claim is an amount for which the Appeals Board accelerated procedure, set forth in <cite path="21.10.06.12">COMAR 21.10.06.12</cite>, may be used;</text>
      <text>"(2) 180 days after the procurement officer receives the claim for a claim not covered under G(1) of this clause; or</text>
      <text>"(3) A longer period that the procurement officer and contractor agree to in writing.</text>
      <text>"H. The final decision may award a contract claim only for those expenses incurred not more than 30 days before contractor was initially required to have filed the notice of claim.</text>
      <text>"I. The procurement officer's decision is the final action of the agency. If the procurement officer fails to render a final decision within the time required, contractor may deem the failure to be a final decision not to pay the claim.</text>
      <text>"J. If the final decision grants the claim in part and denies the claim in part, the agency shall pay contractor the undisputed amount. Payment of the partial claim is not an admission of liability by the agency and does not preclude the agency from recovering the amount paid if a subsequent determination modifies the final decision.</text>
      <text>"K. Contractor may file a written appeal with the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals within 30 days of receipt of notice of the decision.</text>
      <text>"L. Pending resolution of a claim, contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance of the contract in accordance with the procurement officer's decision."</text>

    <text>Mandatory provision for all construction contracts:</text>

      <text>“Termination for Default — Damages for Delay — Time Extensions</text>
      <text>“(1) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work, or any separable part thereof, with such diligence as shall insure its completion within the time specified in this contract, or any extension thereof, fails to complete said work within this time, or fails to provide any required annual and renewable bond 30 days prior to expiration of the current bond then in effect, the State may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the Contractor’s right to proceed with the work or the part of the work as to which there has been delay. In this event the State may take over the work and prosecute the same to completion, by contract or otherwise, and may take possession of and utilize in completing the work the materials, appliances, and plant as may be on the site of the work and necessary therefor. Whether or not the Contractor’s right to proceed with the work is terminated, the Contractor and its sureties shall be liable for any damage to the State resulting from the Contractor’s refusal or failure to complete the work within the specified time.</text>
      <text>“(2) If fixed and agreed liquidated damages are provided in the contract and if the State so terminates the Contractor's right to proceed, the resulting damage shall consist of such liquidated damages until a reasonable time as may be required for final completion of the work together with any increased costs occasioned the State in completing the work.</text>
      <text>“(3) If fixed and agreed liquidated damages are provided in the contract and if the State does not so terminate the Contractor's right to proceed, the resulting damage shall consist of these liquidated damages until the work is completed or accepted.</text>
      <text>“(4) The Contractor's right to proceed may not be so terminated nor the contractor charged with resulting damages if:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>The delay in the completion of the work arises from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, including but not restricted to, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of the State in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, acts of another Contractor in the performance of a contract with the State, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, unusually severe weather, or delays of subcontractors or suppliers arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of either the Contractor or the subcontractors or suppliers; and</text>

        <text>The Contractor, within 10 days from the beginning of any such delay (unless the procurement officer grants a further period of time before the date of final payment under the contract), notifies the procurement officer in writing of the causes of delay. The procurement officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of the delay and extend the time for completing the work when, in the procurement officer’s judgement, the findings of fact justify such an extension, and the procurement officer’s findings of fact shall be final and conclusive on the parties, subject only to appeal as provided in the “Disputes” clause of this contract.</text>
      </para>
      <aftertext>“(5) If, after notice of termination of the Contractor's right to proceed under the provisions of this clause, it is determined for any reason that the Contractor was not in default under the provisions of this clause, or that the delay was excusable under the provisions of this clause, the rights and obligations of the parties shall, if the contract contains a clause providing for termination for convenience of the State, be the same as if the notice of termination had been issued pursuant to the clause. If, in the foregoing circumstances, this contract does not contain a clause providing for termination for convenience of the State, the contract shall be equitably adjusted to compensate for the termination and the contract modified accordingly; failure to agree to any such adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause of this contract entitled “Disputes”.</aftertext>

Not later than 15 days thereafter, the State shall accept title to such items and remove them or enter into a storage agreement covering the same; provided, that the list submitted shall be subject to verification by the procurement officer upon removal of the items, or if the items are stored, within 45 days from the date of submission of the list, and any necessary adjustment to correct the list as submitted shall be made prior to final settlement.</text>
      </para>
      <aftertext>"(3) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, the Contractor shall submit to the procurement officer the Contractor’s termination claim, in the form and with certification prescribed by the procurement officer. Such claim shall be submitted promptly but in no event later than one year from the effective date of termination, unless one or more extensions in writing are granted by the procurement officer, upon request of the Contractor made in writing within such one year period or authorized extension thereof. However, if the procurement officer determines that the facts justify such action, the procurement officer may receive and act upon any such termination claim at any time after such one year period or any extension thereof. Upon failure of the Contractor to submit its termination claim within the time allowed, the procurement officer may determine, on the basis of information available to the procurement officer, the amount, if any, due to the Contractor by reason of the termination and shall thereupon pay to the Contractor the amount so determined.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this clause, the contractor and the procurement officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount or amounts to be paid to the Contractor by reason of the total or partial termination of work pursuant to this clause, which amount or amounts may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done; provided, that such agreed amount or amounts, exclusive of settlement costs, shall not exceed the total contract price as reduced by the amount of payments otherwise made and as further reduced by the contract price of work not terminated. The contract shall be amended accordingly, and the Contractor shall be paid the agreed amount. Nothing in paragraph (5) of this clause, prescribing the amount to be paid to the Contractor in the event of failure of the Contractor and the procurement officer to agree upon the whole amount to be paid to the Contractor by reason of the termination of work pursuant to this clause, shall be deemed to limit, restrict, or otherwise determine or affect the amount or amounts which may be agreed upon to be paid to the contractor pursuant to this paragraph.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(5) In the event of the failure of the Contractor and the procurement officer to agree, as provided in paragraph (4) of this clause, upon the whole amount to be paid to the Contractor by reason of the termination of work pursuant to this clause, the procurement officer shall pay to the Contractor the amounts determined by the procurement officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts agreed upon in accordance with paragraph (4) of this clause.</aftertext>

      <aftertext>The total sum to be paid to the Contractor under paragraph(a) of this clause, shall not exceed the total contract price as reduced by the amount of payments otherwise made and as further reduced by the contract price of work not terminated. Except for normal spoilage, and except to the extent that the State shall have otherwise expressly assumed the risk of loss, there shall be excluded from the amounts payable to the Contractor under paragraph(a) of this clause, the fair value, as determined by the procurement officer, of property which is destroyed, lost, stolen, or damaged so as to become undeliverable to the State, or to a buyer pursuant to paragraph (2)(g) of this clause.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(6) Costs claimed, agreed to, or determined pursuant to paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (9) hereof shall be in accordance with COMAR 21.09 as in effect on the date of this contract.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(7) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal, under the clause of this contract entitled "Disputes", from any determination made by the procurement officer under paragraphs (2), (5), or (9) hereof, except that if the Contractor has failed to submit its claim within the time provided in paragraph (3) or (9) hereof, and has failed to request extension of such time, the Contractor shall have no such right of appeal. In any case where the procurement officer has made a determination of the amount due under paragraphs (3), (5), or (9) hereof, the State shall pay to the Contractor the following:(a) if there is no right of appeal hereunder or if no timely appeal has been taken, the amount so determined by the procurement officer, or (b) if an appeal has been taken, the amount finally determined on such appeal.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(8) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause there shall be deducted(a) all unliquidated advance or other payments or account theretofore made to the Contractor, applicable to the terminated portion of this contract, (b) any claim which the State may have against the Contractor in connection with this contract, and (c) the agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of any materials, supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold, pursuant to the provisions of this clause, and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the State.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(9) If the termination hereunder be partial, the Contractor may file with the procurement officer a claim for an equitable adjustment of the price or prices specified in the contract relating to the continued portion of the contract (the portion not terminated by the Notice of Termination), and such equitable adjustment as may be agreed upon shall be made in such price or prices. Any claim by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be asserted within ninety (90) days from the effective date of the termination notice, unless an extension is granted in writing by the procurement officer.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(10) The State may from time to time, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the terminated portion of this contract whenever in the opinion of the procurement officer the aggregate of such payments shall be within the amount to which the Contractor shall be entitled hereunder. If the total of such payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined to be due under this clause, such excess shall be payable by the Contractor to the State upon demand, together with interest computed at the legal rate for the period from the date such excess payment is received by the contractor to the date on which the excess is repaid to the State; provided, however, that no interest shall be charged with respect to any such excess payment attributable to a reduction in the Contractor's claim by reason of retention or other disposition of termination inventory until ten days after the date of the retention or disposition, or a later date as determined by the procurement officer by reason of the circumstances.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>"(11) Unless otherwise provided for in this contract, or by applicable statute, the Contractor shall, from the effective date of termination until the expiration of three years after final settlement under this contract, preserve and make available to the State at all reasonable times at the office of the Contractor but without direct charge to the State, all its books, records, documents and other evidence bearing on the costs and expenses of the contractor under this contract and relating to the work terminated hereunder, or, to the extent approved by the procurement officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions thereof."</aftertext>

        <text>KNOW ALL BY THESE PRESENTS, That we, the Principal named above and Surety named above, are held and firmly bound unto the Obligee named above in the Penal Sum of this Performance Bond stated above, for the payment of which Penal Sum we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents. However, where Surety is composed of corporations acting as co-sureties, we the co-sureties, bind ourselves, our successors and assigns, in such Penal Sum jointly and severally as well as severally only for the purpose of allowing a joint action or actions against any or all of us, and for all other purposes each co-surety binds itself, jointly and severally with the Principal, for the payment of such sum as appears above its name below, but if no limit of liability is indicated, the limit of such liability shall be the full amount of the Penal Sum.</text>
        <text>WHEREAS, Principal has entered into or will enter into a contract with the State of Maryland, by and through the Administration named above acting for the State of Maryland, which contract is described and dated as shown above, and incorporated herein by reference. The contract and all items incorporated into the contract, together with any and all changes, extensions of time, alterations, modifications, or additions to the contract or to the work to be performed thereunder or to the Plans, Specifications, and Special Provisions, or any of them, or to any other items incorporated into the contract shall hereinafter be referred as "the Contract."</text>
        <text>WHEREAS, it is one of the conditions precedent to the final award of the Contract that these presents be executed.</text>
        <text>NOW, THEREFORE, during the original term of said Contract, during any extensions thereto that may be granted by the Administration, and during the guarantee and warranty period, if any, required under the Contract, unless otherwise stated therein, this Performance Bond shall remain in full force and effect unless and until the following terms and conditions are met:</text>
        <para>
          <num>1.</num>
          <text>Principal shall well and truly perform the Contract; and</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>2.</num>
          <text>Principal and Surety shall comply with the terms and conditions in this Performance Bond.</text>
        </para>
        <aftertext>Whenever Principal shall be declared by the Administration to be in default under the Contract, the Surety may, within 15 days after notice of default from the Administration, notify the Administration of its election to either promptly proceed to remedy the default or promptly proceed to complete the contract in accordance with and subject to its terms and conditions. In the event the Surety does not elect to exercise either of the above stated options, then the Administration thereupon shall have the remaining contract work completed, Surety to remain liable hereunder for all expenses of completion up to but not exceeding the penal sum stated above.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>The Surety hereby stipulates and agrees that no change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of the Contract or to the work to be performed thereunder or the Specifications accompanying the same shall in any way affect its obligation on this Performance Bond, and it does hereby waive notice of any such change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of the Contract or to the work or to the Specifications.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>This Performance Bond shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland and any reference herein to Principal or Surety in the singular shall include all entities in the plural who or which are signatories under the Principal or Surety heading below.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Principal and Surety have set their hands and seals to this Performance Bond. If any individual is a signatory under the Principal heading below, then each such individual has signed below on his or her own behalf, has set forth below the name of the firm, if any, in whose name he or she is doing business, and has set forth below his or her title as a sole proprietor.
