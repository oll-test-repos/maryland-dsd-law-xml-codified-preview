The notice shall specify the acts or omissions relied upon as cause for termination. All finished or unfinished work provided by the Contractor shall, at the State’s option, become the State’s property. The State shall pay the Contractor fair and equitable compensation for satisfactory performance prior to receipt of notice of termination, less the amount of damages caused by Contractor’s breach. If the damages are more than the compensation payable to the Contractor, the Contractor will remain liable after termination and the State can affirmatively collect damages. Termination hereunder, including the determination of the rights and obligations of the parties, shall be governed by the provisions of <cite path="21.07.01.11|B.">COMAR 21.07.01.11B</cite>.”</text>

If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a subcontractor, and if the default arises out of causes beyond the control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either of them, the Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs for failure to perform unless substitute performance for the subcontractor was obtainable from another source in sufficient time to permit the Contractor to meet the performance schedule.</text>

If, after notice of termination of this contract under the provisions of this clause, it is determined for any reason that the Contractor was not in default under the provisions of this clause, and if this contract does not contain a clause providing for termination for convenience of the State, the contract shall be equitably adjusted to compensate for such termination and the contract modified accordingly; failure to agree to any such adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause of this contract entitled “Disputes.”</text>

Payment for completed supplies delivered to and accepted by the State shall be at the contract price. Payment for manufacturing materials delivered to and accepted by the State and for the protection and preservation of property shall be in an amount agreed upon by the Contractor and procurement officer; failure to agree to such amount shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause of this contract entitled "Disputes.” The State may withhold from amounts otherwise due the Contractor hereunder such sum as the procurement officer determines to be necessary to protect the State against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</text>
