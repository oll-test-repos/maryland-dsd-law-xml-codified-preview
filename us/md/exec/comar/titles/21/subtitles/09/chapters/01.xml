        <text>"Cost objective" means any unit of work such as a function, an organizational subdivision, or a contract for which provision is made to accumulate and measure separately the cost of processes, products, jobs, capitalized projects, and similar items. A final cost objective is one that has allocated to it both direct and indirect costs and, in the contractor's accumulation system, is one of the final accumulation points.</text>

      <text>Allocation Consistency. Costs are allocable as direct or indirect costs. Similar costs (those incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances) shall be treated consistently either as direct costs or indirect costs except as provided by these regulations. When a cost is treated as a direct cost in respect to one cost objective, it and all similar costs shall be treated as a direct cost for all cost objectives. Further, all costs similar to those included in any indirect cost pool shall be treated as indirect costs. All distributions to cost objectives from a cost pool shall be on the same basis.</text>

    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>Direct Costs. A direct cost is any cost which can be identified specifically with a particular final cost objective. A direct cost shall be allocated only to its specific cost objective. To be allowable, a direct cost shall be incurred in accordance with the terms of the contract.</text>

      <text>Indirect Costs.</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>An indirect cost is one identified with no specific final cost objective or with more than one final cost objective. Indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to the several final cost objectives after direct costs have been determined and charged directly to the contract or other work as appropriate. Any direct costs of minor dollar amount may be treated as indirect costs, if this treatment produces substantially the same results as treating the cost as a direct cost.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>Indirect costs shall be accumulated into logical cost groups (or pools), with consideration of the reasons for incurring the costs. Each group should be distributed to cost objectives benefiting from the costs in the group. Each indirect cost group shall be distributed to the cost objectives substantially in proportion to the benefits received by the cost objectives. The number and composition of the groups and the method of distribution should not unduly complicate indirect cost allocation where substantially the same results could be achieved through less precise methods.</text>

          <text>The base period for indirect cost allocation is the one in which the costs are incurred and accumulated for distribution to work performed in that period. Normally, the base period is the contractor's fiscal year. A different base period may be appropriate under unusual circumstances. In these cases, an appropriate period should be agreed to in advance.</text>

    <heading>Depreciation and Use Allowances.</heading>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>Depreciation and use allowances, that is, the allowance made for fully depreciated assets, are allowable to compensate contractors for the use of buildings, capital improvements, and equipment or for the provision of these facilities on a standby basis for subsequent use when these facilities are temporarily idle because of suspensions or delays not caused by the contractor, not reasonably foreseeable, and not otherwise avoidable when the contract was awarded. Depreciation is a method of allocating the acquisition cost of an asset to periods of its useful life. Useful life refers to the asset's period of economic usefulness in the particular contractor's operation as distinguished from its physical life. Use allowances provide compensation in lieu of depreciation or other equivalent costs. Consequently, these two methods may not be combined to compensate contractors for the use of any one type of property.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>The computation of depreciation or use allowances shall be based on acquisition costs. When the acquisition costs are unknown, reasonable estimates may be used.</text>

    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>Depreciation shall be computed using any generally accepted method, if the method is consistently applied and results in equitable charges considering the use of the property. The straight-line method of depreciation is preferred unless the circumstances warrant some other method. However, a State agency shall accept any method which is accepted by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>D.</num>
      <text>In order to compensate the contractor for use of depreciated, contractor-owned property which has been fully depreciated on the contractor's books and records and is being used in the performance of a contract, use allowances may be allowed as a cost of that contract. Use allowances are allowable, if they are computed in accordance with an established industry or government schedule or other method mutually agreed upon by the parties. If a schedule is not used, factors to consider in establishing the allowance are the original cost, remaining estimated useful life, the reasonable fair market value, and the effect of any increased maintenance or decreased efficiency.</text>

      <num>E.</num>
