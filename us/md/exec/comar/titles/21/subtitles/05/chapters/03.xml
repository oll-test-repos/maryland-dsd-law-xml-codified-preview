The MBE documentation required by <cite path="21.11.03.10|B.">COMAR 21.11.03.10B</cite> shall be used in making this determination. If the procurement agency is not a department, the procurement officer shall promptly notify all offerors of the recommended contract award, otherwise the notification is optional.

      <text>General. The negotiation, determination, or settlement of the reimbursable amount of overhead under cost-reimbursement type contracts is accomplished after the fact on an individual contract basis and is based upon an audit of actual costs incurred during the period involved. However, if a contractor performs work in the same time period under several contracts for one or more procurement activities, it may be desirable and appropriate, when mutually agreed to by the agencies and the contractor, to negotiate uniform overhead rates for application to all the contracts. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent any procurement agency from establishing a maximum overhead rate.</text>
