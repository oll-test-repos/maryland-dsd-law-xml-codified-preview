      <text>“The bidder or offeror warrants that the information and communication technology offered under this bid or proposal (1) provides equivalent access for effective use by both visual and nonvisual means consistent with the standards of § 508 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Code of Maryland Regulations <cite path="|14.33.02">14.33.02</cite>; (2) provides an individual with disabilities with nonvisual access in a way that is fully and equally accessible to and independently usable by the individual with disabilities so that the individual is able to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as users without disabilities, with substantially equivalent ease of use; (3) will present information, including prompts used for interactive communications, in formats intended for both visual and nonvisual use; (4) if intended for use in a network, can be integrated into networks for obtaining, retrieving, and disseminating information used by individuals who are not blind or visually impaired; and (5) is available, whenever possible, without modification for compatibility with software and hardware for nonvisual access.

If the information and communication technology procured under this solicitation does not meet the nonvisual access standards set forth in the Code of Maryland Regulations <cite path="|14.33.02">14.33.02</cite>, the State will notify the bidder or offeror in writing that the bidder or offeror, at its own expense, has 12 months after the date of the notification to modify the information and communication technology in order to meet the nonvisual access standards. If the bidder or offeror fails to modify the information and communication technology to meet the nonvisual access standards within 12 months after the date of the notification, the bidder or offeror may be subject to a civil penalty of a fine not exceeding $5,000 for a first offense, and a fine not exceeding $10,000 for a subsequent offense.</text>

      <text>“For purposes of this regulation, the phrase ‘equivalent access’ means the ability to receive, use, and manipulate information and operate controls necessary to access and use information and communication technology by nonvisual means.

Without limiting the foregoing, “discrimination” also includes retaliating against any person or other entity for reporting any incident of “discrimination”. Without limiting any other provision of the solicitation for bids on this project, it is understood and agreed that, if this certification is false, such false certification will constitute grounds for the State to reject the bid submitted by the bidder on this project, and terminate any contract awarded based on the bid. As part of its bid or proposal, the bidder shall provide to the State a list of all instances within the immediate past 4 years where there has been a final adjudicated determination in a legal or administrative proceeding in the State of Maryland that the bidder discriminated against its subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, or commercial customers, and a description of the status or resolution of that complaint, including any remedial action taken. As a condition of submitting a bid or proposal to the State, the bidder agrees to comply with the State’s Commercial Nondiscrimination Policy as described under Title 19 of the State Finance and Procurement Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>.”</text>
