      <text>When not acting in the capacity as a member of the Board, the Comptroller's principal responsibility under this title is for the prompt and expeditious payment of valid invoices from contracts approved and submitted by State agencies. The Comptroller's General Accounting Division will document and notify in writing the concerned State agency and the appropriate promulgating authorities of this regulation when the agency has delayed payments. A "delayed payment" condition exists when the date of an individual request for payment received by the General Accounting Division is greater than 25 days from the date the proper invoice is received or the date the services, supplies, maintenance, construction, construction-related, architectural, or engineering services are received and accepted, whichever is later. In this event, the individual request will be considered delayed unless the invoice is a disputed invoice under Regulation .02C.</text>

      <text>That in the event any delay conditions exist due to partial shipments, damaged goods, incomplete services, invoice errors, or disputed invoices, the State agency shall give proper and timely written notification to all concerned parties. A brief description of the reasons for delay shall accompany the invoice when payment is requested from the General Accounting Division in order to avoid being considered a delayed condition. Once approved, the invoices shall be forwarded by the State agency to the General Accounting Division of the Office of the Comptroller for processing and payment in accordance with the instructions contained in the Accounting Procedures Manual for the Use of State Agencies.</text>
