  <heading>Swine Herd Validation for Brucellosis and Validated-free Areas in Maryland</heading>
  <text>Preface</text>
  <text>These regulations are adopted to enable the Department, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to be of greater assistance to Maryland swine producers in a program of brucellosis control and eradication. Testing and validation of an individual herd under this program will be undertaken only at the request of the herd owner. Area testing and validation will be undertaken only with the consent of a majority of the swine breeders within an area.</text>

      <text>Negative Herds. A swine herd will be validated following two consecutive negative tests on the entire breeding herd 30 to 90 days apart. However, if all breeding swine tested on the first test can be accounted for on the validating test, an extension of time may be granted, but the extension will not be allowed to exceed 180 days. This includes all breeding animals 6 months old and older. Validation is effective for 12 months unless otherwise revoked. The validated status will apply to all offspring born since the last test. A swine of unknown brucellosis status or of a suspicious brucellosis status may not be added to or associated with a validated herd or a herd in the process of becoming validated. Herd validation will be voided under these circumstances.</text>
