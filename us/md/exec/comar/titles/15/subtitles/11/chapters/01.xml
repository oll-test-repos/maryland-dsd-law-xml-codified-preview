Application for this permission shall be made in writing by the person wishing to import the animals, at least 10 days before the anticipated movement. Issuance of all permits for importation will be at the discretion of the Secretary. All animals imported under special permits and all animals that do not meet the requirements of these regulations are subject to a period of quarantine, and are required to undergo, at the owner's risk and expense, such test or tests as the Secretary may prescribe.</text>
