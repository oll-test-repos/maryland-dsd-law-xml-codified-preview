    <heading>General.</heading>
    <text>This chapter explains the State's cost sharing program to assist eligible applicants in implementing certain agricultural practices which will lessen water pollution caused by nutrients, sediment, animal wastes, or agricultural chemicals. Under this program, grants are made to farmers for the primary purpose of conserving soil and water resources and for protecting or restoring the environment for the public benefit.</text>
