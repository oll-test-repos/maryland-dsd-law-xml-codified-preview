    <heading>Scope.</heading>

    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>All of the land subject to an agricultural land preservation easement acquired by the Foundation is considered to be one parcel of land even if the total acreage comprises separately described parcels or government-assigned tax parcels or accounts. Common ownership of parcels constituting the farm fulfills the legislative intent to protect the future productivity and profitability of Maryland farms. To preserve the integrity of easement land, agricultural land preservation easements generally preclude a landowner from dividing the farm into smaller parcels or conveying less than the whole farm subject to easement without Foundation approval.</text>

      <text>Exception for Agricultural Subdivision. The Foundation may give written approval to a landowner’s request for an agricultural subdivision of the land and separate ownership of the resulting divided parcels for reasons the Foundation considers sufficiently extraordinary to justify an exception to the prohibition against subdivision. The approval for an agricultural subdivision is not an absolute right of a landowner, and requests shall be reviewed by the Foundation on a case-by-case basis to determine if, in the Foundation’s opinion:</text>

Corrective easements are required to formalize the Foundation’s approval. The corrective easements may include other additional terms, conditions, waivers, or restrictions that the Foundation considers appropriate to protect the agricultural purpose and the future profitability of resulting divided farm parcels.

      <text>Procedure. Upon discovery of an unapproved subdivision, the Foundation may either require that the land be restored to its original configuration or it may consider accepting a subdivision request from the owners of all of the resulting divided parcels.

If the Foundation decides to accept a request for an agricultural subdivision, the owners of all of the resulting divided parcels shall submit an application with the documentation required by this chapter. The Foundation shall then determine if the subdivision qualifies for the exception to the subdivision prohibition as provided in this chapter.
