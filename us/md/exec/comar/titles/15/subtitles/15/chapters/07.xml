    <heading>Eligibility.</heading>
    <text>The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation may approve farm, forest, or home occupation related uses or activities of eligible landowners on a farm subject to easement restrictions even though the use or activity does not strictly fall within the definition of traditional agricultural use. Each request shall be reviewed by the Foundation based on the criteria provided by this chapter to determine if a landowner's requested use or activity conflicts with the overall purpose of the easement to preserve the farm for agricultural use and as open-space land.</text>
