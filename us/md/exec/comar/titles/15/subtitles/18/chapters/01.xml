    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>These definitions of identity apply to any commercial fertilizer offered or sold in Maryland. They have been adopted giving due regard to commonly accepted definitions issued by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials, Inc. A commercial fertilizer which is represented to contain fertilizer material, such as provided in these regulations, may be held misbranded if it does not conform to these terms or identity standards.</text>
