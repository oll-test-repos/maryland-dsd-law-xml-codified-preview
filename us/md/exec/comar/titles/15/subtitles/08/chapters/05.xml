    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of certified seed mixing is to provide a system for maintaining the genetic and mechanical purity of certified seed when combined in mixtures of kinds and varieties. Maryland will apply both varietal and mechanical standards to certified seed mixtures. The following regulations apply to all Maryland Interagency Certified Mixtures and include specific requirements for components. These regulations also apply to the interagency certification of single varieties of those kinds listed in Regulation .09A(2), of this chapter, when necessary to continue certification.</text>
