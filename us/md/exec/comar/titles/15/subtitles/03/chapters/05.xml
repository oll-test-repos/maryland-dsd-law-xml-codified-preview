        <text>Stationary Receiving Stations. A permit is required for each stationary receiving station, such as any building, milk plant, or other non-mobile facility where milk and other fluid dairy products are received from the producer. Upon each permit application for a stationary receiving station, the applicant shall state, under oath, the average amount of milk or other fluid dairy products received daily during the 12-month period preceding the application. If the applicant did not purchase milk for the entire 12-month period, he will state the average amount received during the period when milk was purchased by him. If he purchased no milk during any portion of the previous 12 months, he will estimate his receipts for the period for which the permit is requested.</text>

Immediately before any sample is drawn from any container, the contents of the container from which it is drawn shall be thoroughly mixed for a minimum of 5 minutes. A weigh tank, farm milk tank, or other container from which a sample is to be drawn may not have any partition, division, or strainer which divides it, in any way, into more than one compartment. Each sample shall be put into a container of a type, labeled and stored in a manner, and at a temperature specified by the Secretary. Samples shall, at all times, be under the control of a person licensed as a weigher and sampler or as a weigher, sampler, and tester by the Secretary.</text>

      <text>Sampling Procedures—Fresh Samples. When fresh samples (as opposed to time composite samples) are obtained for possible use as the basis of milk fat percentage determinations for producer payment, a representative sample shall be obtained and labeled in a manner approved by the Secretary. The representative sample will be drawn at the time milk is obtained from each producer's farm milk tank, but only by a person licensed under these regulations by the Secretary. A licensee will deliver the sample, with the producer's product, to the appropriate stationary receiving station.</text>

      <text>Fresh Samples. When a permit holder or licensee uses fresh samples, a representative sample shall be tested at least 3 times each month for each producer. The sample shall be tested within a period of 1 day after being drawn, if possible, but never later than 3 days after initially being obtained by a licensee. The residue of the representative sample shall be held on the premises where tested in a manner to maintain it suitable for any testing by the Secretary for an additional period of not less than 2 working days. Fresh representative samples shall be of such size that the residue, for any test by the Secretary, shall be sufficient to make two tests.

      <text>Sampling Procedures—Time Composite Samples. When using time composite samples as the basis of determination for producer payment, a representative fresh sample will be drawn at the time milk is obtained from each producer's farm milk tank and only by a person licensed by the Secretary in accordance with these regulations. A portion of the representative fresh sample shall be incorporated into an acceptable composite bottle and properly maintained at the appropriate stationary receiving station. The proportionate amount of the representative fresh sample incorporated into the composite bottle each day of shipment will be governed by the relative amount of milk shipped by the producer each day so that an accurate proportion will be established in the time composite sample.</text>

When using or developing time composite samples, a representative and correctly proportionate sample shall be taken from each delivery of each producer (as indicated in §F, above) and shall encompass a period of not more than 16 days. The samples shall contain the correct amount and kind of preservative prescribed by the Secretary. The time encompassed by these composite samples shall be the same for all producers at the same stationary receiving station. All time composite samples shall be tested within 3 working days following the close of the period encompassed by the samples. After all time composite samples have been tested, their residue shall be held on the premises where tested and in a manner to maintain them suitable for testing by the Secretary. These samples shall be held and properly maintained for a period of not less than 7 days. Time composite samples shall be of such adequate size that the residue for testing by the Secretary shall be sufficient for two tests.</text>

Whenever time composite samples are used, the composite bottle shall be of more than sufficient capacity to contain the total volume of the daily proportionate amount of representative samples for the maximum number of days encompassed by the time composite sample. The composite bottle shall be of a type that can be tightly stoppered so as to prevent evaporation or the entrance of water and may not contain a recessed pouring lip. Stoppers shall be of rubber, glass, or other approved nonabsorbent material. Cork may not be used.</text>
