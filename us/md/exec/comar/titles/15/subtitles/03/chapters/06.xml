      <text>Initial Calibration. Any person seeking to use automated testing equipment for measuring milk fat content in raw, unhomogenized milk as a basis of payment to producers shall first cause the equipment to be calibrated in accordance with these regulations. The Department shall be notified at least 10 State working days before initial calibration is to be conducted. The initial calibration may be performed only after the equipment has been installed and stabilized as approved by the Secretary. The initial calibration shall be performed by the equipment operator under the supervision of the Secretary, in accordance with the procedures approved by the Secretary.

    <heading>Operating Procedures.</heading>
    <text>Once the automated testing equipment has been calibrated in accordance with the initial calibration procedures provided in these regulations, it may be used to determine the milk fat content of raw unhomogenized milk, provided it is operated in compliance with the following procedures:</text>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>Control Milk Samples. Milk samples to be used as control milk samples shall be prepared in accordance with the following procedures:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Eight samples of natural herd milk shall be prepared in accordance with Regulation .06.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>These eight samples shall be tested three times by the reference method. The milk fat content of each sample shall be determined by averaging the results of the three tests to the nearest 0.01 percent. They shall contain a milk fat content within the range being tested by the equipment.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>The samples shall then be tested immediately by the automated equipment. The results of the three tests for each sample shall be averaged as provided in §A(2), above.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(4)</num>
        <text>If the standard deviation of difference between the average of the results obtained using the two methods does not exceed 0.06 percent, the equipment may continue to be used. If the (Sd) exceeds 0.06 percent, the equipment shall cease being used and be inspected to determine why the (Sd) exceeds this limit, be repaired, if necessary. and then recalibrated in accordance with the initial calibration procedures as set forth in <cite path="|15|03|06|.06">Regulation .06 of this chapter</cite>. The Department need not be notified as to this recalibration.</text>

        <text>Upon proper zero adjustment, a performance check shall be made by measuring a control milk sample four times in the automated testing equipment.

      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>If in the performance check the difference between the milk fat content of the control milk sample and the averaged results of the two tests conducted using the automated testing equipment (D) is greater than 0.06 percent milk fat, the determination shall be repeated using three additional control milk samples, each of which shall be tested in duplicate.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>If the difference (D) of any of the three additional samples is again greater than 0.06 percent milk fat, then the equipment shall be recalibrated according to the procedures provided for initial calibration as provided in Regulation .06.</text>

    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>When the automated testing equipment is being used to determine the milk fat content of milk as a basis of payment to producers, a control milk sample will be tested by the automated testing equipment once every hour of its operation or once every 50 samples tested, whichever occurs first. If the difference between the milk fat content as measured by the equipment and the milk fat content of the control milk is 0.06 percent or less, the equipment may be continued in use as a basis of measuring milk fat content to determine payments to producers. If the difference is greater than 0.06 percent, the equipment shall cease being used for this purpose and shall be checked in accordance with Regulation .07, above. All test results obtained from the equipment subsequent to the last acceptable check as provided by this regulation as well as all payments to producers based on these tests shall be void. The equipment may not be used for determining payments to producers until it shall have been checked and calibrated, if necessary, in accordance with Regulation .07, above.</text>
