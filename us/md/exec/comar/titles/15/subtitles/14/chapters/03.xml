    <heading>Animal Housing and Care.</heading>
    <text>For the purposes of these regulations, comfortable and satisfactory housing is defined as any system of management, care, and housing that permits animals to be maintained in good health. Some of the specific considerations that give meaning to this definition are outlined below:</text>

      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>It should be designed with the animals' physical comfort as a primary consideration. Physical comfort, as applied scientifically to the housing system, includes keeping the animal dry and clean, maintaining the animal in a state of relative thermal neutrality, providing sufficient space to assure freedom of movement, and allowing for normal postural adjustments, avoiding unnecessary physical restraint, providing convenient access to appropriate food and water, and, if animals are group housed, maintaining them in compatible groups without overcrowding.</text>

        <text>If animals (for example, dogs) are housed outdoors with no access to indoor facilities, provisions to aid their natural temperature regulations are essential. When the ambient temperature falls below 50 degrees F, some form of shelter and an acceptable clean nesting material shall be provided, except for horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. When the ambient temperature exceeds 85 degrees F, shade shall be available and animals should be able to burrow or lie on materials several degrees cooler than the surrounding air.</text>

      <text>Power and Lighting. The electrical system should provide ample lighting, sufficient power outlets, safety provisions (such as explosion-proof outlets in rooms where volatile, explosive anesthetics may be used), and waterproof outlets where water is used in cleaning. Lighting shall be uniformly diffused throughout the area to be served. Although 10 to 15 footcandles of light are considered sufficient to maintain vital animal activity and rhythms, at least 50 footcandles are necessary for ordinary servicing of animal enclosures. For most animal housing areas, a minimum lighting intensity of 75 footcandles at the level of the cage racks is required. Animal treatment and examination areas should have a minimum of 100 footcandles at the work surface. Provision shall be made for emergency lighting in the event of a power failure.</text>
