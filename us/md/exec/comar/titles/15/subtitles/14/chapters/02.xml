    <heading>Scope.</heading>
    <text>This chapter concerns formal and informal actions of the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners to enforce the laws and regulations governing the practice of veterinary medicine in this State. The Board may take action against alleged violators, including a veterinarian, a veterinary technician, an owner of a veterinary hospital, an owner of a mobile veterinary clinic, and an owner of an animal control facility.  This chapter describes the Board’s procedures for investigating possible violations of the Maryland Veterinary Practice Act that it discovers, and complaints it receives within 3 years of the complained-of conduct, and older complaints upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.  Additionally, this chapter describes procedures for contested case hearings before the Board and alternative dispute resolution procedures, including confidential case resolution procedure and mediation.</text>
