    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>These regulations establish the requirements for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of agricultural drainage projects that are financed or managed by public drainage associations. To the maximum extent practicable, these regulations assure protection of natural resources and prevent water pollution by non-point source pollutants associated with agricultural drainage projects.</text>
