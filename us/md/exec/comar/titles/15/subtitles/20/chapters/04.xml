      <text>When a nutrient management plan is prepared for a farm it indicates how essential primary nutrients, that is, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are to be annually managed on farm fields for crop production and for the protection of water quality. Plans contain recommendations to farmers based on expected crop yield, existing nutrient levels in the soil, organic residuals, optimum timing and placement of nutrients, environmental protection, and normal farming practices such as liming, tillage, and crop rotation. The Department shall certify qualified individuals to prepare these plans.</text>
