        <text>When it is not possible or feasible to weigh a vehicle by any of the methods described in this regulation, a law enforcement officer may require the operator of a vehicle to travel to the nearest appropriate private or State-owned scale, which complies with the standards of §K(5), (6), and (7) of this regulation for the purpose of weighing the vehicle. This includes, but is not limited to, vehicles operating on a State Highway Administration permit and vehicles using routes which bypass a scale location.</text>

        <text>Normally, a distance of approximately 10 miles may be considered reasonable for requiring an operator or a vehicle to proceed to a scale for weighing. Ten miles is not to be considered an absolute distance, since unusual circumstances may require travel in excess of 10 miles.</text>
