      <text>This chapter applies to both new and existing buildings and conditions. In various sections there are specific provisions for existing buildings that may differ from those for new buildings. Unless otherwise noted, this chapter does not apply to facilities, equipment, structures, or installations that were existing or approved for construction or installation before the effective date of this chapter, except in those cases in which it is determined by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) that the existing situation constitutes a hazard so inimical to the public welfare and safety as to require correction. The requirements for existing buildings and conditions may be modified if their application clearly would be impractical in the judgment of the AHJ, but only if it is clearly evident that a reasonable degree of safety is provided. The State Fire Marshal or the legally appointed designee has the authority to make a determination of the applicability of this chapter to any building or condition in it, subject to the right of appeal to the State Fire Prevention Commission as prescribed in <cite path="|29.06.02">COMAR 29.06.02</cite>.</text>
