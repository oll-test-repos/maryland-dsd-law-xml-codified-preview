    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>Eligible persons may be granted the privilege of leaving confinement during necessary and reasonable hours for the purposes of leave, working at gainful private or public employment, or attending school as part of a school release program. These programs may also include, under appropriate conditions, release for the purpose of seeking employment or schooling. Leave, work release, and school release are considered prerelease programs intended to prepare eligible persons for parole, mandatory supervision, or expiration of sentence. An eligible person does not have any right to be granted leave, work release, or school release. Leave, work release, and school release are privileges to be granted or revoked at the discretion of the Board of Review.</text>
