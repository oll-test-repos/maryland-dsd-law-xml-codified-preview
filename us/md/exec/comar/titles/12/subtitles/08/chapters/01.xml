      <text>Publicity. To promote and assist the reintegration into the community of those persons released on parole, it is the desire of the Commission that as little publicity as possible be given the individual parolee. The Commission, as a matter of policy, opposes the publication of names and addresses of those persons being released on parole, as experience has proven that this publicity often has a detrimental effect upon the individual's acceptance in a neighborhood, upon his employer, and upon his ultimate parole success.</text>
