      <text>This chapter describes the process to be followed to apply for participation in the Program. While the law permits an individual to apply for participation in the Program on that individual's own behalf, it is anticipated and encouraged that assistance with the application be provided by domestic violence programs or other professionals who may be counseling the survivor. In this regard, the regulations streamline the application process when the required documentation is provided by individuals associated with domestic violence programs or other application assistants registered with the Secretary.</text>
