      <text>Definitions. In this Executive Order, the following terms have the meaning indicated.</text>
      <para>
        <num>1.</num>
        <text>The term “artificial intelligence” or “AI” has the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 9401(3):  a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.  Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text>The term “generative AI” or “GenAI” refers to AI algorithms and models that can create new content, including audio, code, images, text, and video, based on the data they are trained on.</text>
      </para>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>Principles. Any use of AI in Maryland state agencies shall be rooted in the following.</text>
      <para>
        <num>1.</num>
        <text>Fairness and equity.</text>
        <text>The State’s use of AI must take into account the fact that AI systems can perpetuate harmful biases, and take steps to mitigate those risks, in order to avoid discrimination or disparate impact to individuals or communities based on their race, color, ethnicity, sex, religion, age, ancestry or national origin, disability, veteran status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or any other classification protected by law.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text>Innovation.</text>
        <text>When used responsibly and in human-centered and mission-aligned ways, AI has the potential to be a tremendous force for good. The State commits to exploring ways AI can be leveraged to improve State services and resident outcomes.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>3.</num>
        <text>Privacy.</text>
        <text>Individuals’ privacy rights should be preserved by design in the State’s use of AI, while ensuring that data creation, collection, and processing are secure and in line with all applicable laws and regulations.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>4.</num>
        <text>Safety, security, and resiliency.</text>
        <text>AI presents new challenges and opportunities for ensuring the safety and security of Maryland residents, infrastructure, systems, and data. The State commits to adopting best practice guidelines and standards to surface and mitigate safety risks stemming from AI, while ensuring AI tools are resilient to threats.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>5.</num>
        <text>Validity and reliability.</text>
        <text>AI systems can change over time. The State should have mechanisms to ensure that these systems are working as intended, with accurate outputs and robust performance.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>6.</num>
        <text>Transparency, accountability, and explainability.</text>
        <text>The State’s use of AI should be clearly and regularly documented and disclosed, in order to enable accountability. The outputs of AI systems in use by the State should be explainable and interpretable to oversight bodies and residents, with clear human oversight.</text>
