      <num>1.01</num>
      <text>The Maryland flag was adopted as the State flag by an Act of the General Assembly in 1904 (Maryland Code, State Government Article, Section 13-201).</text>

      <num>1.02</num>
      <text>The Maryland flag is divided into four quarters. The first and fourth quarters consist of six vertical bars alternately yellow (representing gold) and black with a diagonal band on which the colors are reversed. The yellow and black quarters represent the family arms of the first proprietor of Maryland, George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore. The second and third quarters consist of a quartered field of red and white (representing silver) bearing a Greek cross with arms terminating in trefoils. The colors in the second and third quarters alternate, with red being on the white ground and white on the red. The red and white quarters display the arms of Lord Baltimore's maternal family, the Crosslands (Maryland Code, State Government Article, Section 13-202).</text>

When a Maryland banner for pageants, reenactments, commemorations, and other historical occasions is desired, it may consist of the yellow and black Calvert colors displayed as in the first quarter of the Maryland flag. Two pennants, one black and the other yellow, flown on separate staffs may also be appropriately used for historical commemorations and events.</text>

    <para>
      <num>5.01</num>
      <text>The Maryland flag should be flown at half-staff whenever the U.S. flag is so flown. Half-staff means lowering the flag to one-half the distance between the top and the bottom of the staff. When flown at half-staff, the Maryland flag should be hoisted briskly to the peak for an instant and then lowered slowly to half-staff. Before being lowered for the day, the Maryland flag should again be raised to the peak.</text>

      <text>When the U.S. flag and the Maryland flag are flown together at half-staff, whether from adjacent staffs or from a single staff with two halyards, the U.S. flag is raised first and lowered last. When flown from a single staff with one halyard, the Maryland flag is secured to the halyard immediately below the U.S. flag and accompanies it as the U.S. flag is raised to the peak and lowered to half-staff.</text>

    <para>
      <num>5.03</num>
      <text>By order of the Governor or his authorized representative, the Maryland flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of present or former government officials or state and national leaders, and on other occasions as the Governor or his authorized representative directs.

      <text>The Maryland flag may be used to cover the coffin of a State police officer killed in the line of duty, or any other State official or public servant who devoted a substantial part of his or her career to public service in the State. When the Maryland flag is used to cover a casket, it should be placed so that the first quarter is at the head and over the left shoulder. The Maryland flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.</text>

    <para>
      <num>5.07</num>
      <text>During periods of official mourning, the Maryland flag may be draped with crepe when it is not possible to display the flag at half-staff.

    <aftertext>USE OF THE U.S. ENSIGN AND MARYLAND FLAG ON RECREATIONAL BOATS:</aftertext>
    <aftertext>Note: This section does not cover the use of yacht club burgees, owners' private signals, U.S. Power Squadron flags, U.S.C.G. Auxiliary flags, foreign flags, or social and courtesy flags. Rules for these are well-established and may be found in existing literature. The U.S. Ensign with a canton of 50 stars (as the U.S. flag is called while in nautical use) and the U.S. Yacht Ensign, with a canton of 13 stars, are interchangeable on all types of recreational vessels while in national waters. Because the preferred location for the U.S. Power Squadron flag is also the starboard spreader, it may be flown beneath the Maryland flag.</aftertext>
    <para>
      <num>6.01</num>
      <text>The U.S. Ensign and the Maryland flag are normally flown from sunrise to sunset. However, at most yacht clubs "colors are made" at 0800 hours. This timing is proper when in the company of other boats simultaneously making colors. The U.S. Ensign is flown first and lowered last.</text>

      <text>If the Maryland flag is flown on sailing vessels:</text>
      <text>Sloops, cutters, and schooners</text>
      <text>While under way—Sailing vessels with one mast should fly the U.S. Ensign at the stern staff, or two-thirds of the way up the leech of the mainsail (or at the top of leech, if gaff-rigged). The Maryland flag should fly at the starboard spreader, or on the forward mast of a schooner. While at anchor—The U.S. Ensign should fly from the stern staff and the Maryland flag from the starboard spreader.</text>
      <text>Yawls and ketches</text>
      <text>While under way—The U.S. Ensign should fly at the stern staff or at a position two-thirds up the leech of the mizzen sail (or at the peak of the leech of the mizzen sail, if gaff-rigged). The Maryland flag should fly at the starboard spreader ("at the starboard spreader" means the spreader on the most forward mast if more than one and from the most outboard hoist of that spreader). While at anchor—The U.S. Ensign should fly from the stern staff and the Maryland flag from the starboard spreader.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>6.03</num>
      <text>If the Maryland flag is flown on motorboats:</text>
      <text>While under way and at anchor—The U.S. Ensign should fly from the stern staff, and the Maryland flag may be flown from the forestaff in lieu of a yacht club burgee.</text>
      <text>Motorboats with auxiliary masts should follow the rules for sailboats.</text>
