When, as a result of emergency conditions, any facility is closed after the start of normal work hours or shifts and the employees assigned to the facility who have reported for work are dismissed, there shall be no loss of pay or charge to leave of any kind.

        <text>Employees who are required to perform duties after an emergency condition is declared shall be compensated by compensatory time or additional pay as declared eligible and specified under Department of Personnel regulation and/or policy concerning work hours and overtime. Such additional compensation shall be equivalent to the release time of those employees who are released from the same facility.</text>
