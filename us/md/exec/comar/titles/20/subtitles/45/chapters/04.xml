      <text>Payment Date. All regular monthly customer bills shall state the date by which the customer shall pay the bill in order to avoid suspension notice or other utility collection procedures.

      <text>Overcharge—Undercharge Adjustment. When a customer has been overcharged or undercharged for services because of incorrect application of the rate schedule, inaccurate measuring of services rendered, incorrect calculation of charges or similar reasons, the amount of overcharge or undercharge adjustment shall be determined separately during the period of time the discrepancy occurred, in accordance with the following:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Overcharge Only. The total overcharge for the period the discrepancy occurred shall be refunded or credited to the customer.</text>

        <text>Undercharge Only.</text>
        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>Unless authorized by the Commission, retroactive billing may not be for undercharges which occurred more than 12 months before the discovery of the error. A utility may seek the Commission's authorization for retroactive billing for undercharges which occurred more than 12 months but not more than 3 years before the discovery of the error if the customer knew, or reasonably should have known, that the bills were in error. The utility's request to the Commission shall be in writing and shall explain the factual basis for the request to the customer with a notice of the customer's right to write to the Commission, within 20 days, if the customer is in opposition to the request.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(b)</num>
          <text>If the total undercharge is more than 35 percent of the customer's average monthly bill during the preceding 3 months, the customer shall be allowed to enter into an installment plan to pay the total retroactive billing, without interest. In such a plan the monthly payments against the undercharge may not exceed 35 percent of the customer's average monthly bill during the preceding 3 months. However, if the installment plan will not recover within a 12-month period the total undercharge, the monthly payment may be equal to the total undercharge divided by 12 or a number greater than 12.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(c)</num>
          <text>Unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, the utility may deny service for nonpayment only for that portion of the undercharge applicable to the 4 months immediately before the discovery of the error.</text>
