However, in a special situation the applicant may be required to bear a part of the cost of crossing the street or road.</text>

      <text>Utility's Portion of Extension. The utility shall extend its sewer mains to serve new customers, other than subdivisions, housing projects, industrial developments, etc., at its own expense, when the cost of the required total length of main extension plus any special pumping facilities required is not in excess of three times the estimated annual revenue to be derived from the extension, which amount shall be designated the "allowance."</text>

The amount of the advance to the utility may not include any costs of increasing the size or capacity of the utility's existing mains or any other facilities used or necessary in connection with the proposed extension, except as provided in Â§L, below. If the actual cost of the extension is less than the estimated cost, the utility shall promptly refund to the applicant any overpayment.</text>

      <num>L.</num>
      <text>Extension to Subdivision, Etc. An applicant for a main extension to serve a new subdivision, tract, housing project, or industrial development shall be required to advance to the utility before construction is commenced the estimated reasonable cost of installation of the mains, from the nearest existing main at least equal in size to the main required to serve the development, including necessary service stubs or service pipelines, fittings, pumping stations, etc. If additional facilities are required specifically to provide the service requested, the cost of these facilities may be included in the advance upon approval by the Commission.</text>

      <text>Basis For Refunds. For each new customer connected to an extension on which the utility holds refundable deposits, the utility shall refund three times the estimated annual revenue to be derived from the customer. Refunds shall be made within 90 days after the new customer's service is connected and shall be made to the depositors who advanced the money for the extension. If more than one depositor is entitled to receive a refund, the total amount shall be divided in proportion to the amount of the unrefunded advance of each depositor.</text>

      <num>N.</num>
      <text>Disposition of Advances. Advances which may be required from applicants in payment for extensions will be held by the utility without interest. Refunds shall be made in accordance with these regulations and no depositor will have refunded to him an amount in excess of the amount of his advance.
