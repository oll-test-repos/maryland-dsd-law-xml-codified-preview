      <text>In order to assure purchasers of health care hospital services that rates are set equitably among all purchasers of services without undue discrimination, a hospital may not intentionally or otherwise engage in cross-subsidization without approval by the Commission. A hospital may grant a discount only as provided for in <cite path="10.37.10.26">COMAR 10.37.10.26</cite>.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>Without the prior approval of the Commission, neither a hospital, a related entity, nor any entity or person acting on behalf of or in concert with a hospital shall enter into a fixed-price contract, or knowingly participate in or receive the benefit of any arrangement, directly or indirectly, pertaining to the delivery of hospital services. A hospital that has knowledge of such an arrangement shall promptly notify the Commission in accordance with this section in order that the Commission may determine whether the arrangement constitutes an unapproved discount. In order to obtain prior approval of the Commission, the hospital shall file a written application in accordance with <cite path="10.37.10.06">COMAR 10.37.10.06</cite>. The filing of this application constitutes the filing of a required report under Commission law and regulation. Failure to file an application before the date on which a fixed-price contract is entered into, or the hospital or related entity knowingly participates in or receives benefit of such an arrangement, may subject the organization or organizations to fines up to $1,000 per day for each day the arrangement exists without prior approval.</text>

      <text>For a period beginning with the effective date of this regulation and for a period of 6 months after that, the Commission shall offer an amnesty period. Any hospital which brings to the Commission's attention within the 6-month amnesty period any arrangement to which it is, directly or indirectly, a party shall have any price or compliance penalties which might otherwise have been imposed against it in connection with the arrangement, as set forth in <cite path="|10|37|12|.03">Regulation .03 of this chapter</cite>, waived. The waiver shall expire at the later of the end of the 6-month amnesty period or the consideration of the Commission of the approval of the arrangement.</text>

      <text>The Commission may impose penalties of up to $1,000 per day, which shall be instead of the $100 per day penalty for failing to file reports as set forth in <cite path="10.37.01.03|N.">COMAR 10.37.01.03N</cite>, for a required report submitted by a hospital that includes information which has the effect of violating <cite path="|10|37|12|.02">Regulation .02 of this chapter</cite>.

      <text>A hospital that violates the provisions of <cite path="|10|37|12|.02">Regulation .02 of this chapter</cite> shall, in addition to any penalties imposed under <cite path="10|37|12|.03|A.">Â§A of this regulation</cite>, be subject to the overcharge and undercharge penalties contained in <cite path="10.37.03.05">COMAR 10.37.03.05</cite>, which shall be applied to the difference between what was actually charged by the hospital and what the hospital would have been required to charge under a valid Commission rate order based on accurate information filed. In addition, the Commission may revoke any discount previously granted under <cite path="10.37.10.26">COMAR 10.37.10.26</cite> to a third party that participates in an arrangement determined by the Commission to constitute an unapproved discount or otherwise violates the provisions of <cite path="|10|37|12|.02">Regulation .02 of this chapter</cite>.</text>
