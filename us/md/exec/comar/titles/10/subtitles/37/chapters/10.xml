The staff shall make modifications to the ICC which are needed to properly reflect any additional factors that are relevant to the determination of a reasonable cost level that should be reflected in the hospital’s approved regulated revenue. The ICC analysis does not constitute a strict, unalterable or absolute methodology. It shall be modified as needed to give proper attention to the particular circumstances of the hospital, and the staff shall give due consideration to information provided by the hospital in determining the appropriate rate levels and rate structure for the hospital. The ICC shall take into account, in the establishment of appropriate rate levels, those factors for which the hospital will not be held accountable such as special grants from the Commission, assessments, uncompensated care levels, and characteristics of the population in the hospital’s primary service area.</text>

      <text>The GBR shall be implemented through a written agreement entered into by the Commission and each individual general acute hospital. This agreement and any addenda thereto, which shall be annual and renewed automatically, shall set forth all relevant provisions governing the GBR including, but not limited to, performance corridors; interim rate adjustments; the exclusion or special treatment of certain cases; the treatment of volume changes, including those involving residents of Maryland and other patients; the penalties associated with failure to comply with the terms of the GBR agreement; interim revenue limits; care redesign requirements; and other changes to the agreement that may be needed from time to time. A hospital that enters into a GBR agreement shall submit a signed copy of the agreement to the Commission’s offices within 60 days after it is initially approved by the Commission. A hospital that is party to the addendum shall submit a signed copy of the addendum to the Commission’s offices within 60 days from the issuance of the addendum. Failure to submit the signed GBR agreement or the signed addendum in a timely manner, absent an extension granted by staff, may subject the hospital to penalties under <cite path="10.37.01.03|R.">COMAR 10.37.01.03R</cite>. Thereafter, on an annual basis, the hospital shall receive an updated rate order. A hospital that disagrees with a proposed GBR may file a full rate application with the Commission in accordance with <cite path="|10|37|10|.03">Regulation .03 of this chapter</cite>.</text>

        <text>If after approving an update factor for a given year, a hospital or hospitals collectively exceed their approved revenue, the annual update factor may be reduced in future years to recoup the excess revenue growth.
