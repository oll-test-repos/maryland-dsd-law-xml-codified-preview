The Commission shall consider this action only in those instances when the annual gross revenue for nonphysician services is not more than $20 million (in 1996 dollars), adjusted by an appropriate index of inflation, or when the annual gross revenue subject to Commission rate-setting jurisdiction is not more than $5 million (in 1996 dollars) adjusted by an appropriate index of inflation.</text>
