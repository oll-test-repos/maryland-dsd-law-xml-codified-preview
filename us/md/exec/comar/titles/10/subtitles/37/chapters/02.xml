        <text>In the event of a merger or consolidation as a result of which one or more of the participating hospitals no longer provides inpatient care at its existing location, the Commission shall approve rates for the surviving hospital or hospitals such that the revenues of the surviving hospital or hospitals are increased based upon one of two variable cost calculations, with the merged or consolidated facility choosing between the options.</text>

        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>The first alternative is for the surviving hospital or hospitals to receive in relation to the new admission variable costs in the first year equal to 80 percent. This figure shall be reduced to 70 percent in the second year for those new admissions. For the third year and after that, the variable cost amount built into the hospital's base for these admissions shall be 60 percent. These variable cost percentages shall be limited to the number of admissions at the closed hospital. These amounts shall be applied to the average cost of hospitals in the screening group of the closed hospital (adjusted for wage differences as appropriate).</text>

        <text>A merged or consolidated hospital may request rates from the Commission at any time consistent with Commission law and regulation. A review of the hospital's request shall be undertaken in accordance with the review and approval procedures developed by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under Health-General Article, §19-217. Those procedures shall establish reasonable rates based upon the premise that hospitals are to provide effective and efficient service.</text>
