      <text>"Psychiatric day treatment services" means intensive, nonresidential psychiatric treatment for any part of a 24-hour day for a minimum of 4 consecutive hours per day. Patients admitted to these services are those for whom at the time of admission, it is reasonable to anticipate that maximum day treatment benefits would be achieved within 30 full treatment days. If at any point in the course of treatment it is believed that patients would benefit from additional intensive treatment, beyond the 30-day period, continued day treatment may be provided, but the record shall document justification for the continued intensive treatment. Day treatment services provide flexible scheduling to meet the needs of the individual patient so that the 30 treatment days may nor may not be consecutive. The services given may be part of a psychiatric hospital program, or a psychiatric unit of a general hospital, or a free-standing community-based mental health program which has an arrangement for appropriate support services with a licensed general hospital or a licensed psychiatric hospital. Psychiatric day treatment services provide active psychiatric treatment. Psychiatric day treatment services do not provide residential care, nor are they identical with socializing and activity programs, recreational community programs, or day care facilities which do not provide active psychiatric treatment.</text>
