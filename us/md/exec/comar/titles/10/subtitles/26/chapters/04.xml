Code" path="gho|1A">Health Occupations Article, §1A</cite>–309, Annotated Code of Maryland, to place a licensee or registered auricular detoxification specialist on probation, reprimand, suspend, fine, or revoke a license. The Board may consider aggravating and mitigating factors in determining sanctions.</text>
