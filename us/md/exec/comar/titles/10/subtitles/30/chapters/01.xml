    <text>In recognition of its continuing responsibility to its citizens to aid in reduction of the personal financial hardships associated with end-stage renal disease, the State continues its commitment of resources to the Kidney Disease Program of Maryland. This subtitle is designed so that Maryland may provide help and support for its citizens whose needs are partially or wholly unmet by present federal or private support, or both, for end stage renal disease.</text>
