      <text>The Board of Podiatric Medical Examiners wishes to inform you that, under the law of Maryland, you may not be charged a fee for podiatric goods or services which have been advertised as "free". Nor may you be charged more than the "reduced or discounted" fee advertised for particular podiatric goods or services. In addition, before a podiatrist may charge you a fee to treat immediately or within 72 hours a problem diagnosed at the time you received free, reduced, or discounted podiatric goods or services, you shall consent in writing to accept that treatment. The podiatrist shall explain to you whether he or she thinks that you need the treatment immediately or within 72 hours, or whether your condition does not require immediate treatment. The decision to accept treatment immediately or at a later date is always your decision. If you desire to accept treatment immediately or within 72 hours of today, please sign this document as required by law. Please be aware that you may be financially responsible for payment for the goods or services you receive.</text>
