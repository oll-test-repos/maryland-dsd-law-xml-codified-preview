    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>Dentists are increasingly administering anesthesia and sedation on an outpatient basis. It is in the best interests of the public and the dentists of Maryland to require dentists who administer anesthesia and sedation to meet certain minimal training and competency standards. Requiring a dentist to obtain a permit before the dentist may administer anesthesia, sedation, or both is the best method to ensure that such administration is performed by competent dentists trained in the use of such techniques.</text>
