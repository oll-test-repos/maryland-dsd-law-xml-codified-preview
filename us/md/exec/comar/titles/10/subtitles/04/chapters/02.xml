The midnight method is to be used for billing days of care of patients. A part of a day, including the day of admission, counts as a full day, however, the day of discharge, the day of death, or a day on which a patient begins a leave of absence is not counted as a day. If admission and discharge or admission and death occur the same day, the day is considered a day of admission and counts as one in-patient day.</text>
