    <text>This chapter establishes a cancer registry within the Department, defines key terms, details the information to be contained in a cancer report, and specifies requirements of reporting facilities, nursing facilities, assisted living programs, and general hospice care programs. In addition, this chapter identifies requestors authorized to receive confidential data, allows a fee to be charged for data reports, and incorporates by reference the Maryland Cancer Registry Data Use Manual and Procedures (July 2016).</text>
