In calculating retrospective cost reimbursement rates, the Department or its designee will deduct from the designated costs or group of costs those restricted contributions which are designated by the donor for paying certain provider operating costs, or groups of costs, or costs of specific groups of participants. When the cost, or group or groups of costs designated, cover services rendered to all participants, including Medical Assistance participants, operating costs applicable to all participants shall be reduced by the amount of the restricted grants, gifts, or income from endowments, thus resulting in a reduction of allowable costs.</text>
