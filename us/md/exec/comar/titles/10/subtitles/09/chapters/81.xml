    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of the Increased Community Services (ICS) Program is to enable certain nursing facility residents to access home and community-based services by allowing those nursing facility residents to contribute to the cost of care through a monthly assessment and thus enabling those individuals to live at home with ICS and other Medicaid services instead of in a nursing facility.</text>
