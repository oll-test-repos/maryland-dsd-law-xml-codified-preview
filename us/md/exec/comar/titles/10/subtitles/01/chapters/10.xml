    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The Secretary of Health (MDH) has established accounts for the purpose of payment of off-grounds medical services. These accounts are to be used by MDH facilities whose clients receive services from private medical providers that the facility cannot furnish or secure by contract. The care could include laboratory work, services from medical specialties, and acute hospitalization. The care does not include ambulance transportation.</text>
