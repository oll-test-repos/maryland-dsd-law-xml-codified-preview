      <text>Reinstatement. Each individual contract shall contain in substance the following provision: “Reinstatement: If any renewal premium is not paid in full within the time granted the subscriber for payment, a later acceptance of premium in full by the HMO or by any agent authorized by the HMO to accept the premium, without requiring a reinstatement application in connection with the acceptance of the premium in full, shall reinstate the contract. However, if the HMO or the agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the contract will be reinstated upon approval of the application by the HMO or, lacking approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of the conditional receipt unless the HMO has previously notified the subscriber in writing of its disapproval of the reinstatement application. The subscriber and HMO shall have the same rights under the reinstated contract as they had under the contract immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed on the contract or attached to the contract in connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.”</text>
