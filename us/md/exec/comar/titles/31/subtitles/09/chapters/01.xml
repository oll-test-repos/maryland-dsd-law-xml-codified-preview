    <heading>Plan of Insurance.</heading>
    <text>Wholesale life insurance policies may be issued on the yearly or more frequently renewable term plan or on any other term or on any whole life or endowment plan. If the policy is issued on the yearly or more frequently renewable term plan or any other term plan, it shall contain the right of renewal to at least age 65 nearest birthday (subject, however, to the insurer's right to refuse renewal in accordance with <cite path="|31|09|01|.05">Regulation .05 of this chapter</cite>), and shall contain the right to convert to a whole life or endowment plan after termination of the final term period. However, the policy need not provide the privilege of renewal of term insurance on a dependent child beyond age 19 nearest birthday. Whenever the policy is not eligible for renewal as a wholesale life insurance policy, it shall contain such additional conversion rights as are hereinafter set forth if written on a yearly or more frequently renewable term basis or, if written on other than a yearly or more frequently renewable term basis, shall give the insured employee or member the right to continue the insurance under the original policy at the same premium, or at a stated higher premium which may not exceed rates charged by the insurer for ordinary policies issued under the same policy plan of insurance for the same class of risk.</text>

The insurer may reserve the right to change the table of rates upon 30 days prior written notice to the sponsor and to the insured employee or member, the change to become effective on a premium due date or on a policy renewal date specified in the notice, but an increase in rates may not become effective within 1 year after issue of the policy or after the effective date of any prior change in the table of rates.</text>

    <heading>Notice of Conversion.</heading>
    <text>Whenever a conversion privilege is available under the policy or whenever a policy which is not eligible for renewal as a wholesale life insurance policy may be continued by payment of an increased premium, the insurer shall give the individual employee or member insured written notice of the right to convert or continue. The notice shall be given not more than 60 days before or more than 15 days after the termination or nonrenewal of insurance under the wholesale life insurance policy. If the notice is given more than 15 days after termination or nonrenewal of insurance, the time allowed for the exercise of the privilege of conversion or payment of the increased premium shall be extended for 15 days after the giving of the notice, but not beyond 90 days after the termination or nonrenewal of insurance. An extension of the time to convert or continue the policy does not operate to extend the coverage beyond the period stated in the policy, unless the policy specifically provides for an extension of the coverage. Written notice under this provision may be given by timely mailing of the notice to the employee or member insured at the employee's or member's most recent address known to the insurer or to the sponsor. Notice described in this regulation is not required when the policy may be continued as a wholesale life insurance policy with the same sponsor at an increased premium which is called for in the policy's schedule of premiums because of an increase in the attained age of the person insured or because of a change in the table of rates stated in the policy. In event of a change in the table of rates, notice shall be given as set forth in <cite path="|31|09|01|.03|B.">Regulation .03B of this chapter</cite>.</text>

      <num>A.</num>
      <text>With respect to each insured employee or member, an individual policy which identifies the insured employee or member by name shall be issued covering himself or his dependents, or both. The policy shall contain all of the provisions required by §§B—M of this regulation, except that any provision or portion thereof which in the opinion of the Commissioner is not applicable to the plan of insurance shall, to the extent inapplicable, not be incorporated in the policy. In lieu of any of the provisions required by this chapter, the Commissioner may approve any provision which he deems more favorable to the policyholder.</text>

      <num>B.</num>
      <text>Grace Period. A grace period of not less than 30 days shall be allowed within which the payment of any premium payable under the policy (except the first premium) may be made, during which grace period the policy shall continue in full force. If a claim arises under the policy during the grace period, the insurer may deduct the amount of any premium due from the policy proceeds.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>Incontestability.

      <text>Entire Contract.

      <text>Beneficiary. The policy shall have endorsed on it, or on an application attached to it, the name of the beneficiary and reserve to the policy owner the right to change the beneficiary unless the owner elects to designate a beneficiary irrevocably. The policy may also provide that if the beneficiary designated in the policy does not make a claim under the policy or does not surrender the policy with due proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which may not be less than 30 days after the death of the insured, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured, or is a minor, or dies before the insured, or is not legally competent to give a valid release, then the insurer may make any payment under the policy to the estate of the insured, or to any relative of the insured by blood or legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled to payment by reason of having been named beneficiary, or by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention, or burial of the insured. The policy may also include a similar provision applicable to any other payment due under the policy. At the option of the insurer, the policy may also provide that no designation or change of beneficiary shall be binding on the insurer until endorsed on the policy by the insurer, or otherwise accepted by the insurer, and that the insurer may refuse to endorse the name of any proposed beneficiary who does not appear to the insurer to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. If the policy provides that the proceeds may be payable in installments or as an annuity, the policy shall include a table showing the amount and period of the installment or annuity if determinable at issue.</text>

      <text>Policy Loans. The policy shall contain a provision that after 3 full years premiums have been paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security of the policy, at a specified rate of interest not exceeding an effective rate of 6 percent per annum, an amount equal to or, at the option of the person entitled to payment, less than the loan value of the policy. The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, provided that the insurer may deduct, either from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due, it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, then the policy shall terminate and become void, but not until at least 30 days notice has been mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the insured or policy owner and of any assignee of record at the home office of the insurer. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for 6 months after application therefor. The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the person entitled to elect. At the option of the insurer, this provision may be omitted in a policy of term life insurance.</text>

    <text>A wholesale life insurance policy may include, or may provide by rider, health insurance benefits, in which case the policy shall contain provisions relating to the health insurance which may not be less favorable to the insured employee or member than the applicable provisions required under <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gin">Insurance Article, Title 15, Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>, and under any applicable regulations issued thereunder for a policy providing similar benefits. Upon discontinuance of the policy as a wholesale life insurance policy, any health insurance benefits originally provided may not be included in any conversion privilege unless the insurer, at its option, shall so provide, in which case the provision in the policy regarding the conversion privilege shall clearly indicate the extent of health insurance benefits which may be continued after the policy ceases to be a wholesale life insurance policy.</text>
