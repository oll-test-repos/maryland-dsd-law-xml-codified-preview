    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of this chapter is to provide rules for life insurance policy illustrations that will protect consumers and foster consumer education. The chapter provides illustration formats, prescribes standards to be followed when illustrations are used, and specifies the disclosures that are required in connection with illustrations. The goals of this chapter are to ensure that illustrations do not mislead purchasers of life insurance and to make illustrations more understandable. Insurers will, as far as possible, eliminate the use of footnotes and caveats and define terms used in the illustration in language that can be understood by a typical person within the segment of the public to which the illustration is directed.</text>

      <text>Each insurer marketing policies to which this chapter is applicable shall notify the Commissioner whether a policy form is to be marketed with or without an illustration.

This quotation is not considered an illustration for purposes of this chapter, but all information provided shall be consistent with the illustrated scale. A basic illustration shall be provided at delivery of the certificate to enrollees for non-term group life who enroll for more than the minimum premium necessary to provide pure death benefit protection. In addition, the insurer shall make a basic illustration available to any non-term group life enrollee who requests it.</text>
