      <strong>Long-Term Care Insurance</strong>
    </text>
    <text>
      <strong>Personal Worksheet</strong>
    </text>
    <text>People buy long-term care insurance for many reasons. Some don't want to use their own assets to pay for long-term care. Some buy insurance to make sure they can choose the type of care they get. Others don't want their family to have to pay for care or don't want to go on Medicaid. But long-term care insurance may be expensive, and may not be right for everyone.</text>
    <text>By state law, the insurance company must fill out part of the information on this worksheet and ask you to fill out the rest to help you and the company decide if you should buy this policy.</text>
    <text>
      <strong>Premium Information</strong>
    </text>
    <text>Policy Form Numbers<strong> ________________________</strong></text>

[The company has never raised its rates for any long-term care policy it has sold in this state or any other state.] [The company has not raised its rates for this policy form or similar policy forms in this state or any other state in the last 10 years.] [The company has raised its premium rates on this policy form or similar policy forms in the last 10 years. Following is a summary of the rate increases.]</text>
    <text><strong>Drafting Note:</strong> A company may use the first bracketed sentence above only if it has never increased rates under any prior policy forms in this state or any other state. The issuer shall list each premium increase it has instituted on this or similar policy forms in this state or any other state during the last 10 years. The list shall provide the policy form, the calendar years the form was available for sale, and the calendar year and the amount (percentage) of each increase. The insurer shall provide minimum and maximum percentages if the rate increase is variable by rating characteristics. The insurer may provide, in a fair manner, additional explanatory information as appropriate.</text>

      <text><strong>This policy is Guaranteed Renewable.</strong> This means that the rates for this product may be increased in the future. Your rates can <strong>NOT</strong> be increased due to your increasing age or declining health, but your rates may go up based on the experience of all policyholders with a policy similar to yours.</text>
      <text>
        <strong>If you receive a premium rate or premium rate schedule increase in the future, you will be notified of the new premium amount and you will be able to exercise at least one of the following options:</strong>
      </text>
      <text>• Pay the increased premium and continue your policy in force as is.</text>
      <text>• Reduce your policy benefits to a level such that your premiums will not increase. (Subject to state law minimum standards.)</text>
      <text>• Exercise your nonforfeiture option if purchased. (This option is available for purchase for an additional premium.)</text>
      <text>• Exercise your contingent nonforfeiture rights.* (This option may be available if you do not purchase a separate nonforfeiture option.)</text>
      <text>
        <strong>* Contingent Nonforfeiture</strong>
      </text>
      <text>If the premium rate for your policy goes up in the future and you didn't buy a nonforfeiture option, you may be eligible for contingent nonforfeiture. Here's how to tell if you are eligible:</text>
      <text>You will keep some long-term care insurance coverage, if:</text>
      <text>• Your premium after the increase exceeds your original premium by the percentage shown (or more) in the following table; and</text>
      <text>• You lapse (not pay more premiums) within 120 days of the increase.</text>
      <text>The amount of coverage (i.e., new lifetime maximum benefit amount) you will keep will equal the total amount of premiums you've paid since your policy was first issued. If you have already received benefits under the policy, so that the remaining maximum benefit amount is less than the total amount of premiums you've paid, the amount of coverage will be that remaining amount.</text>
      <text>Except for this reduced lifetime maximum benefit amount, all other policy benefits will remain at the levels attained at the time of the lapse and will not increase thereafter.</text>
      <text>Should you choose this Contingent Nonforfeiture option, your policy, with this reduced maximum benefit amount, will be considered "paid-up" with no further premiums due.</text>
      <text>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
      </text>
      <text>• You bought the policy at age 65 and paid the $1,000 annual premium for 10 years, so you have paid a total of $10,000 in premium.</text>
      <text>• In the 11th year, you receive a rate increase of 50%, or $500 for a new annual premium of $1,500, and you decide to lapse the policy (not pay any more premiums).</text>
      <text>• Your "paid-up" policy benefits are $10,000 (provided you have at least $10,000 of benefits remaining under your policy.)</text>

      <aftertext>• In the sixth year, you receive a rate increase of 35% and you decide to stop paying premiums.</aftertext>
      <aftertext>• Because you have already paid 50% of your total premium payments and that is more than the 40% ratio, your "paid-up" policy benefits are .45 (.90 times .50) times the total benefit amount that was in effect when you stopped paying your premiums. If you purchased inflation protection, it will not continue to apply to the benefits in the reduced "paid-up" policy.</aftertext>
