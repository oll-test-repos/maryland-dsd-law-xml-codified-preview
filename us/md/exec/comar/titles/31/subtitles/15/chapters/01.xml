    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of this chapter is to assure fair disclosure of relevant facts in the sale of life insurance and annuity contracts. This chapter is also designed to protect citizens of Maryland as purchasers and prospective purchasers of life insurance policies or annuity contracts against the use of sales methods which are misleading because of:</text>

      <text>The omission of facts fairly describing the subject matter as a life insurance policy or annuity contract and the benefits obtainable thereunder;</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>An undue emphasis upon facts which, however true, are not relevant to the sale of life insurance or annuities; or</text>

      <text>Because of the inherently confusing nature of a guaranteed annual endowment type of policy, a life insurance policy or annuity contract containing a series of guaranteed annual endowments evidenced by coupons, passbooks, or similar devices generally identified with investment or banking operations may not be approved for use, and any such policy or contract heretofore approved may not be issued or delivered in this State on or after September 1, 1970.</text>

        <text>The insured shall be entitled to withdraw the guaranteed annual endowments not less frequently than at the end of the second policy year and at the end of each policy year thereafter, the amount of the endowments available for withdrawal not to be less than the aggregate premium paid for the endowments less any prior withdrawals;</text>

    <heading>Charter or Founders' Policies.</heading>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>A charter policy or founders' policy is that form of life insurance policy or annuity contract usually issued by a newly organized insurer, which is sold on the basis that its availability will be limited to a specific predetermined number of units of a fixed dollar amount and which generally provides that the policyholder shall participate in the earnings resulting from either the participating policies or the nonparticipating policies sold by the insurer, or perhaps both. The prospective purchaser may be led to believe that he will receive a special advantage in any future distribution of earnings, profits, or dividends not available to those persons holding other types of policies issued by the insurer.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>The sale of charter policies and founders' policies represents an unfair method of competition. They purport to offer certain benefits which are not authorized by statute and are without reasonable expectation of achievement. These policies misrepresent the responsibility and obligation of an insurer for equitable distribution of dividends. Therefore, a charter policy or founders' policy may not be approved for use and a charter policy or founders' policy heretofore approved may not be issued or delivered in this State on or after September 1, 1970.</text>
