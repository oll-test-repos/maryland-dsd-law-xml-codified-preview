Code" path="gin|15-303">Insurance Article, §15-303(f), Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>, which was enacted as part of Chapter 554, Acts of 1999 (SB 350). The Attorney General approved the enactment for constitutionality and legal sufficiency, but determined that the standard provision requiring employers, labor unions, associations, and other purchasers of group insurance to notify insurers immediately on termination of an individual insured or continue to pay premiums after coverage has ceased, was likely preempted by the federal Employees' Retirement Security Act (ERISA).</text>
