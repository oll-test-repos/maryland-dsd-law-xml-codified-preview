        <text>The policy contains no exclusions for preexisting conditions except conditions which, within 6 months before the effective date of the coverage, manifested themselves to the insured debtor by requiring medical consultation, diagnosis, or treatment, provided the preexisting conditions cause loss commencing within 6 months following the effective date of the coverage, and provided further that the preexisting conditions would ordinarily be expected to affect materially the health of the debtor during that period. Loss due to total disability shall include loss of time from work, and, in the case of persons not employed, the inability of the insured to engage in the insured's usual and customary activities. In the case of disability by reason of loss of time from work, total disability for which benefits may become due and payable shall be defined as "inability by reason of injury or sickness to substantially perform the duties pertaining to the insured's occupation" for at least the first 12 months for which a claim may be made, and after that may be defined as "inability to substantially perform the duties of any business or occupation for which the insured is reasonably fitted by education, training, and experience." Disability commencing 6 months or more after the effective date of the coverage may not be excluded regardless of whether the disability results from any preexisting condition. The policy shall provide that if the indebtedness covered by the policy results from the refinancing in whole or in part of a prior debt with the same creditor, the period of exclusion for preexisting conditions shall be reduced by the period that creditor-debtor disability coverage was in force in connection with the prior indebtedness. However, if the resulting period of exclusion for preexisting conditions is less than the period that would normally be applicable, and if, as a result, a claim for disability benefits which would not otherwise be allowed is payable, the benefits for the claim need not be greater than those which would have been paid under the prior coverage if it had not terminated.</text>
