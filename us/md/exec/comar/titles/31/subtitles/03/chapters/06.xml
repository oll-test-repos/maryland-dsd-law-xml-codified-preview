    <text>Before placing any surplus line or otherwise acting as a surplus lines broker, where Maryland is the Home State of the insured, it will be the responsibility of each individual so acting to acquire a valid Maryland surplus lines broker’s certificate of qualification. The broker will be held responsible for securing timely renewals of the broker’s certification of qualification in order to place new business and provide a continuity of service to clients for whom the broker has previously acted. Each original surplus lines broker’s certificate of qualification shall be issued for a term expiring every other year on the date stated on the certificate of qualification and may be renewed biennially thereafter.</text>

      <text>DISCLOSURE REGARDING SURPLUS LINES INSURANCE.</text>
      <text>Please Read the Following Carefully Before Purchasing Insurance From a Surplus Lines Insurer.</text>
      <text>This policy is issued by a surplus lines insurer that has been approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration to issue insurance policies in the surplus lines insurance market. Surplus lines insurers are not under the jurisdiction of the Maryland Insurance Administration and do not possess a certificate of authority to transact insurance business in the State of Maryland. Because surplus lines insurers are not under the jurisdiction of the Maryland Insurance Administration, your ability to seek assistance from the State if you have a problem with your insurance company is limited.</text>
      <text>Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation and Maryland Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corporation provide funds that permit certain claimants or policyholders to receive payment of covered claims if their insurance company becomes insolvent (i.e., bankrupt) and is unable to pay the claims. However, these funds do not apply to surplus lines insurers, as a surplus lines insurer is not a member insurer of the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation or the Maryland Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corporation. If a surplus lines insurer becomes insolvent (i.e. bankrupt), any claim that you have against the surplus lines insurer will not be covered by the funds administered by Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation and Maryland Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corporation.</text>
      <text>If you have any questions regarding this disclosure or surplus lines insurance, please contact the Maryland Insurance Administration at 410-468-2340.</text>
