      <text>It is deemed to be an unfair trade practice in the business of insurance for any insurance producer licensed both in Maryland and in another state or the District of Columbia to place insurance on risks located in Maryland for Maryland citizens with insurers not authorized to do business in this State.</text>
      <text>Agency Note: The Insurance Administration has noted several recent instances where agents or brokers licensed both in Maryland and in another state or the District of Columbia have placed insurance on risks located in Maryland for Maryland citizens with insurers not authorized to do business in this State. While all transactions relating to the making of this insurance may be done outside Maryland, the practice is contrary to the intent of the Legislature as expressed in Insurance Article, §§<cite doc="Md. Code" path="gin|4-101">4-101</cite>(a), <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gin|4-204">4-204</cite>, and <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gin|4-205">4-205</cite>, Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended to date, and is deemed to be against the best interest of the citizens of this State.</text>
