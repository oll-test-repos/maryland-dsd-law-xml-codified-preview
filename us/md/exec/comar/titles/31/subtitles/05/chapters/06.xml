    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of this chapter is to protect the interests of policyholders of life insurers and property and casualty insurers admitted to do business in Maryland by limiting the amount of high yield/high risk obligations in which an insurer may invest, so that the assets of the insurer will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, permitting policyholders to rely with confidence on the insurer's ability to fulfill its contractual obligations.</text>
