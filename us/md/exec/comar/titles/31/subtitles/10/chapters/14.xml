      <text>If the report referred to in <cite path="|31|10|14|.05">Regulation .05 of this chapter</cite> with respect to a policy form or combination of similar policy forms indicates that the form or forms are not meeting the loss ratio requirements of <cite path="|31|10|14|.03">Regulation .03 of this chapter</cite>, the insurer, within 30 days after the due date of the report, shall file for an appropriate reduction in premium to be effective not later than 90 days after the due date of the report. The filing shall include an actuarial memorandum as described in <cite path="|31|10|14|.04">Regulation .04 of this chapter</cite>. If the insurer does not propose a reduced premium which in the opinion of the Commissioner meets the requirements of these regulations, the Commissioner shall afford the insurer a hearing upon due notice. If, as a result of the hearing, the Commissioner finds that the premium proposed to be charged by the insurer would not be likely to result in a loss ratio meeting the requirements of these regulations, he may withdraw approval of the affected policy form or forms in accordance with Insurance Article, <br/>§12-203(c)(5), Annotated Code of Maryland.</text>
