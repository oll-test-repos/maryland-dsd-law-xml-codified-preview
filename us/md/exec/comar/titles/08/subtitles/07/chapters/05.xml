        <text>Site Index. To determine a site index, a measurement is taken in trees which have a dominant position in the forest crown. In the eastern United States, including Maryland, the base age for computing site index is 50 years. This age combined with the height of the tree species for which the index is to be determined will provide an index of site capability, or a site index number ranging from 60 to 100. The higher the number, the greater the site capability. Points shall be assigned to a site index as follows:</text>
