      <text>Purpose. There is a State wildlands preservation system composed of areas in the State designated by the General Assembly as wildlands areas. The wildland areas shall be administered for the use and enjoyment of the people of Maryland in a manner that will leave them unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wildlands, to provide for their protection, for the preservation of their wildland character, and for gathering and dissemination of information regarding their use and enjoyment. For a description of the boundaries of an individual wildland, see <cite doc="Md. Code" path="gnr|5-1203">Natural Resources Article, §5-1203, Annotated Code of Maryland</cite>.</text>

        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>“Type 1 wildland” means a primitive area which by its size and location is in effect untouched by urban civilization and can offer the experience of solitude and self-reliance. Type 1 wildlands are usually lands located at higher elevations that protect watersheds and are ecologically vulnerable to human interferences.</text>

        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>“Type 2 wildland” means a unit of importance for natural sciences and ecology with outstanding value for education, research, and appreciation of natural processes. Preservation of the desired natural condition is the prevailing purpose of the Type 2 wildlands.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>“Type 3 wildland” means an area which is not of ecological or primitive stature but which has the appearance of being in an untouched natural state.</text>
