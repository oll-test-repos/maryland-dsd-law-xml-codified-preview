      <text>Jennings Randolph Lake is a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers facility sharing a common boundary with Maryland and West Virginia. The states have been granted concurrent enforcement authority on the project, as to the land and the water areas. The states have agreed to enforce essentially identical boating regulations and to share enforcement responsibilities. A fundamental consideration is preserving an acceptable quality of recreational experience on the Lake while providing for the greatest use consistent with a quality experience and safety for all users.</text>
