    <text>The Department may recover overpayments by beginning civil actions or, in the discretion of the Secretary, overpayment may be offset against current or future payments of unemployment insurance benefits to which the overpaid claimant is entitled. If the Department chooses to recover the overpayment by offset, the amount of the offset may be 100 percent of the current or future weekly benefit entitlement. The Department may not recover an overpayment before the time for requesting an overpayment waiver has expired, while a timely filed waiver request is pending decision by the Secretary or the Secretary’s designee, or while a timely filed appeal of the denial of an overpayment waiver request is pending.</text>
