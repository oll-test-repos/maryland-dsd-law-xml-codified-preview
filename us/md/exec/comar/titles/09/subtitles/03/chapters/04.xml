      <text>Except as provided elsewhere in this regulation, if an insurance premium is financed as part of an installment sale agreement, whether for dual interest physical damage insurance or third-party liability insurance, or both, and the insurance is terminated for any reason by the insurer and the unearned premium returned to the holder of the installment sale agreement, the holder immediately shall remit the unearned premium to the buyer less only those amounts then due and payable under the contract.</text>

If the holder makes this election, the holder is not required to offer the buyer any option as described in <cite path="09|03|04|.03|D.">§D of this regulation</cite>, and the full amount of the buyer's indebtedness under the contract, including the amount so remitted, shall remain intact.</text>
