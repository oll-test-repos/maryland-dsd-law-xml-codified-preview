      <text>Former regulations as originally adopted effective July 1, 1972, included industrialized buildings and manufactured homes. The HUD Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards superseded the State standards for manufactured homes on June 15, 1976. Approval of manufactured home inspection agencies and manufactured home plans is also now a responsibility of HUD or its agent, so these regulations pertain primarily to industrialized buildings. Regulation .15 does, however, cover the functions of the Department as a State Administrative Agency under HUD programs. Related manufactured home functions, such as handling of consumer complaints and monitoring of primary inspection agencies, are not covered by this chapter.</text>

A design analysis of critical features will be included with the certification letter. In special situations such as a newly approved manufacturer on a temporary basis, or a limited production manufacturer, the Department may waive the requirement of the contract with an approved testing facility and provide plan review and monitoring for factory operations and the quality assurance program directly, charging the fees prescribed in <cite path="|09|12|52|.12">Regulation .12 of this chapter</cite>.</text>

      <text>Effect of Affixing State Certification Insignias.

      <text>When a design is unusual, and involves special analysis, the Department will also charge a rate of $25 per man-hour to cover its added costs. When practical, the Department will estimate costs before submittal and provide a report on hourly activities. If the complexity or sophistication of the system requires, or if the applicant so chooses, the Department may submit the plan for the system to an approved independent testing agency or consulting engineer for evaluation. In this case, the applicant will be required to pay whatever costs the agency may charge. If the applicant chooses to obtain prior analysis by an approved testing agency before submission, the Secretary will consider this in determining the charges to be made by the Department. However, test reports from the approved agency shall be submitted with the original application.</text>

    <text>Upon the application of another state for reciprocity, or upon his own initiative, the Secretary shall investigate if the other state has adopted and promulgated a code and enforcement procedures which establish standards and safeguards at least equal to those contained in these regulations. He will hold a public hearing to state the findings of his investigation and give interested parties the opportunity to submit their comments both for and against the adoption of a reciprocity agreement with the other state. Following the hearing, the Secretary shall decide whether a reciprocity agreement will be granted. As part of the finding by the Secretary granting reciprocity to another state, the Department shall set out the specific terms and conditions of the reciprocity agreement as it applies to that state and manufacturers of industrialized buildings under that state's program. As part of the reciprocity agreement, each state will keep the other informed of any changes in its regulations and maintain a current list of manufacturers that have been approved under its program. Upon application by any person adversely affected by the reciprocity agreement, the Secretary may investigate the allegations, and if necessary, hold a public hearing. Based on the results of his investigation, the Secretary may rescind, modify, or continue in effect the reciprocity agreement.</text>

      <text>General. The National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards, Inc.

States electing to participate in this program agree to accept any one- or two-family dwelling which bears the NCSBCS label and the label of the state where the dwelling is to be erected as complying with the state's design and construction standards for manufactured dwellings. Under the program, NCSBCS will accredit System Analysis Agencies and Compliance Assurance Agencies. System Analysis Agencies will evaluate manufacturer's Building System Certification Documents (BSCD's). Compliance Assurance Agencies will perform ongoing inspections to determine whether dwellings are built to BSCD requirements, including conformance to an approved Compliance Assurance Manual.</text>
