        <text>"Tower crane" means a type of lifting structure which utilizes a vertical mast or tower to support a working boom (jib) in an elevated position.  Loads are suspended from the working boom.  While the working boom may be of a fixed type, horizontal or angled, or have luffing capability, it can always rotate to swing loads, either by rotating on the top of the tower such as top slewing or by the rotation of the tower such as bottom slewing.  The tower base may be fixed in one location or ballasted and moveable between locations.  Mobile cranes that are configured with luffing jib or tower attachments, or both, are not considered tower cranes under this section.</text>
