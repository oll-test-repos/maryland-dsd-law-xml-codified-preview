Red maintains its own place of business but does not perform service for more than one person or company at a time. Either JB or Red can end the services at any time. Red pays federal employee taxes.

      <text>The Green Company (Green), a landscaping company, is hired to landscape a building complex. Once the work is underway, the owner of the building complex decides to install a pond with a waterfall. Green does not build ponds and waterfalls so it subcontracts that work to the Water Company (Water). Water is licensed to build ponds with waterfalls, and it carries workers' compensation and liability insurance under the company name. Water performs services for more than one person at a time. All equipment and tools necessary for the pond installation are owned by Green. Because of Water's experience in the area, there is no oversight of the daily work by Green. Water is paid by Green at the completion of the job. However, Green is ultimately responsible for the final product if there are any faults or defects in the construction. Water is an independent contractor.</text>

      <text>HVAC, Inc. (HVAC) is the mechanical subcontractor on a large hospital construction contract. There is so much work to perform that HVAC contracts with two other companies, Air Supply, Inc. (Air Supply) and Kool and the Gang, Inc. (Kool), to assist with the work.

HVAC retains some supervisory control over the employees of the other companies to make sure that the job is being done to the specifications of the overall mechanical contract. Air Supply and Kool exercise supervision over the installation methods of their respective workforces. Even though the two subcontractors are in the same business as HVAC and they perform the same type of work at the same location as HVAC, there is no employer-employee relationship between the contracting companies, and there is no employee-employer relationship between the subcontractors' employees and HVAC.</text>

      <text>ABC Company (ABC) hires three crews of workers to do the siding on new houses in a residential development. ABC pays each of the crews per square foot of siding installed. ABC tells each crew leader that they are independent contractors responsible for their own workers' compensation premiums and any taxes. None of the crew leaders appears to have their own business, and they fail to get any workers' compensation coverage. One of the crew leaders is designated as general foreman and has been given total responsibility for running the job, but ABC has a superintendent who periodically walks the site to make sure the work is done properly. ABC also provides safety equipment for each worker. At the end of each week, ABC pays the crew leaders a lump sum based on the square footage of siding installed. The crew leader then pays each worker based on how much siding they installed. The workers doing the siding are employees of ABC.</text>
