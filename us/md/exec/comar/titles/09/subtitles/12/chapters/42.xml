      <text>Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to promote equality of opportunity in apprenticeship and encourage the fullest development of the interests and aptitudes of apprentices by prohibiting discrimination based on political or religious opinion or affiliation, marital status, race, color, creed, national origin, sex, or age, unless sex or age constitutes a bona fide occupational qualification, or the physical or mental disability of a qualified individual with a disability in apprenticeship programs, by requiring affirmative action to provide equal opportunity in apprenticeship programs, and by coordinating these regulations with other equal opportunity programs.</text>

      <text>Definition of Affirmative Action. Affirmative action is not mere passive nondiscrimination. It includes procedures, methods, and programs for the identification, positive recruitment, training, and motivation of present and potential minority and female (minority and nonminority) apprentices including the establishment of goals and timetables. It is action which will equalize opportunity in apprenticeships so as to allow full use of the work potential of minorities and women. The overall result to be sought is equal opportunity in apprenticeships for all individuals participating in or seeking entrance to the State labor force.</text>

        <text>An acceptable affirmative action plan shall also include adequate provision for outreach and positive recruitment that would reasonably be expected to increase minority and female participation in apprenticeship by expanding the opportunity for minorities and women to become eligible for apprenticeship selection. To achieve these objectives, sponsors shall undertake activities such as those listed below. It is not contemplated that each sponsor necessarily will include all of the listed activities in its affirmative action program. The scope of the affirmative action program will depend on all the circumstances including the size and type of the program and its resources. However, the sponsor will be required to undertake a significant number of appropriate activities in order to enable it to meet its obligations under these regulations. The affirmative action plan shall set forth the specific steps the sponsor intends to take in the areas listed below. Whenever special circumstances warrant, the Council may provide the assistance it deems necessary to implement the requirements of this section.</text>

For programs customarily receiving applications throughout the year, the information shall be regularly disseminated but not less than semiannually. The information shall be given to the Council, local schools, employment service offices, women's centers, outreach programs and community organizations which can effectively reach minorities and women, and shall be published in newspapers which are circulated in the minority community and among women, as well as in the general areas in which the program sponsor operates.</text>

        <text>"Under-utilization" as used in this section refers to the situation where there are fewer minorities or women (minority and nonminority) in the particular craft or crafts represented by the program than would reasonably be expected in view of an analysis of the specific factors in §E(1)—(5) of this regulation. When, on the basis of the analysis, the sponsor determines that it has no deficiencies, no goals or timetables need be established.

      <text>Analysis to Determine Whether Deficiencies Exist.

      <text>Establishment and Attainment of Goals and Timetables.</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>The goals and timetables shall be established on the basis of the sponsor's analysis of its under-utilization of minorities and women and its entire affirmative action program. A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women is acceptable unless a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner in which case separate goals shall be established for the group. Separate goals would be required, for example, if a specific minority group of women were under-utilized even though the sponsor had achieved its standards for women generally.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>In establishing the goals, the sponsor should consider the results which could be reasonably expected from its good faith efforts to make its overall affirmative action program work. Compliance with these requirements shall be determined by whether the sponsor has met its goals within its timetable, or failing that, whether it has made good-faith efforts to meet its goals and timetables. Its good-faith efforts shall be judged by whether it is following its affirmative action program and attempting to make it work, including evaluation and changes in its program when necessary to obtain the maximum effectiveness toward the attainment of its goals.</text>

        <text>However, in order to deal fairly with program sponsors, and with women who are entitled to protection under the goals and timetables requirements, during the first 12 months after the effective date of these regulations, the program sponsor would generally be expected to set a goal for women for the entering year class at a rate which is not less than 50 percent of the proportion women are of the workforce in the program sponsor's labor market area and set a percentage goal for women in each class beyond the entering class which is not less than the participation rate of women currently in the preceding class. At the end of the first 12 months after the effective date of these regulations, sponsors are expected to make appropriate adjustment in goal levels.

The requirements of this subparagraph shall also be applicable to aptitude tests used by a program sponsor which are administered by a State employment service agency, or any other person, agency, or organization engaged in the selection or evaluation of personnel.
