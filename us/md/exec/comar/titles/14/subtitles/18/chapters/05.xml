      <text>Microfilm shall be of the type suitable for archival quality. Archival quality or permanent film is defined as any film that is equal to or better than silver-gelatin film, as specified in the "American National Standard for Imaging Media (Film)—Silver-Gelatin Type—Specifications for Stability (ANSI/NAPM IT9.1-1992)" and in the "American National Standard for Photography—Determination of Regional Thiosulfate and Other Related Chemicals in Processed Photographic Materials—Methods Using Iodine—Amylose, Methylene Blue and Silver Sulfide (ANSI/NAPM IT9.17-1993)", which are incorporated by reference. Diazo or vesicular film are not acceptable as archival quality microfilm.</text>

      <num>B.</num>
      <text>If an agency is microfilming its own records, it shall be the responsibility of the head of each agency or office to ensure that microfilm equipment is cleaned and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications or accepted industry practice, or both.</text>

      <text>When paper records are to be microfilmed, and the microfilm is scheduled for permanent retention, the paper records may not be destroyed until the microfilming of those records and the subsequent processing and inspection of the film has been completed in compliance with the standards in Regulation .04G and H of this chapter, nor until the State Archivist has  approved the destruction of those records. Permission to destroy record material shall be obtained by filing a Proposal and Certificate of Records Destruction (form DGS-550-9) with the Archives.
