    <text>The Pre-Seed Builder Fund and Inclusion Fund each identify investment opportunities in businesses that are often overlooked by traditional sources of investment and financing because of economic disadvantage and seek to invest in early-stage technology-based businesses that have the potential, with the Pre-Seed Builder Fund investment, the Inclusion Fund investment, or other TEDCO services, to create jobs in the State and become attractive targets for follow-on financing or investment.</text>
