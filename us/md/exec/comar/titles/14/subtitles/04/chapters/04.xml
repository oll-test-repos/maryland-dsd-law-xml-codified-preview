    <heading>Investment Philosophy and Types of Qualified Businesses.</heading>
    <text>The RBII Fund identifies pre-seed investment opportunities in small or early-stage technology-based businesses in rural areas and rural communities that are often overlooked by traditional sources of pre-seed investment because of the location of the businesses’ principal business operations in a rural area or a rural community. The RBII Fund seeks to make investments that TEDCO determines have the potential to enable the business to advance to the next-stage of venture investment and to become an attractive applicant for other TEDCO investment programs not less than 12 to 24 months after investment by the RBII Fund.</text>
