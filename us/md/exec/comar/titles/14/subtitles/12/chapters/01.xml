It shall set forth succinctly the nature of the case, the facts involved, and the question or questions to be reviewed by the Court, as provided by Tax General Article, §13-516(a), Annotated Code of Maryland. Where applicable, the Petition shall also set forth that the assessment or classification appealed from is illegal, specifying the ground or alleged illegality, or that it is erroneous by reason of overvaluation or undervaluation, or that the assessment is unequal in that it has been made at a higher proportion of value than other property of the same class or the Petition may assign any other errors which exist in the particular case for which an appeal is allowed, and on account of which the Petitioner claims to be injured, as provided by Tax Property Article, §14-512, Annotated Code of Maryland.</text>

If such order is not complied with within the time fixed by the Court in said order, the proceedings may be dismissed on the Court's own motion or on motion of the opposing party.</text>

    <text>Where two or more real properties are in the same ownership, and within the same taxing jurisdiction, they may be included in a single Petition of Appeal whenever there exists any substantial question of law or fact common to all the properties. The Court, however, may order separate Petitions filed if in the Court's opinion the issues involved may not conveniently be disposed of in the same proceeding. Where properties are not in the same ownership, they must be made the subject of separate Petitions of appeal, even though common questions of law or fact may be involved.</text>
