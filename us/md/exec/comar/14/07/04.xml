    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>When the Fund has received a Notice of Claim, it shall attempt to contact the uninsured owner or operator, or both, to investigate the liability and damages on the part of the uninsured. It shall also negotiate with claimants to compensate them promptly, fairly, and equitably.</text>

      <num>B.</num>
      <text>If a claimant does not arrive at an agreed settlement with the Fund, the Fund shall notify the claimant in writing that the claimant’s only remedy will be to file suit against the uninsured owner or operator. The claimant shall show that service has been perfected and a judgment has been obtained against the owner or operator, or both the owner and operator, of the uninsured vehicle. The Fund may not be a party to the suit until the claimant has first obtained a judgment against the uninsured owner or operator or unless the Fund elects to intervene as a party. The Fund may not be obligated to intervene.</text>

      <text>The Fund may seek to obtain a consent agreement from the uninsured owner or operator in the form of either a confessed judgment or confessed judgment promissory note before the claimant is paid.
