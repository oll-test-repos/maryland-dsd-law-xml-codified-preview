    <text>Associations licensed by the Commission to conduct harness racing meetings may, with the approval of the Commission, conduct a so-called twin double, subject to the following rules:</text>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>The twin double is a part of the pari-mutuel system of wagering. It is a contract by each participant to pick (select) the winner of each of four races as may be designated by a licensee, with the approval of the Commission. For the purpose of this rule, the four races will be referred to as the "twin double races." The first two races so designated shall be referred to as the first half of the twin double. The third and fourth races so designated shall hereafter be referred to as the second half of the twin double. All sums deposited in the twin double shall be held in a single pool entirely separate from all other pools, and the award or dividend to each winning participant shall be calculated subject to the provisions of this rule, as in a straight pool.</text>
    </para>

    </para>
    <para>
      <num>E.</num>
      <text>Each participant in the twin double shall designate his selections as the winners of the first half of the twin double races at the time he purchases his twin double ticket, and each twin double ticket shall show the selections made.</text>

      <text>Wagering for the Super Bet shall close at the same time that wagering is closed on the first designated race of the Super Bet. If a horse is scratched in a designated race of the Super Bet while wagering on the Super Bet is still open, wagers containing the scratched horse shall be deducted from the Super Bet pool and shall be refunded just as in other types of wagers. After the close of wagering on the Super Bet, refunds of wagers due to scratches may not be made until after prices have been declared official for the entire Super Bet. In the latter event, except as otherwise provided in §I, K, or L, refunds shall be made only for wagers selecting in each designated race of the Super Bet scratched horses and winning horses in the proper order but not any losing horses. For example, if the exact winning combination is 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-3, and the 4 horse in the designated second race was scratched, a wager of 1-2, 4-2, 1-2-3 would be eligible for a refund, but a wager of 1-2, 2-4, 1-2-3 would not be eligible for a refund.</text>

In this event, the winning tickets shall be those combining on that performance the most consecutive finishers in the winning combination, starting with the winner of the first designated race of the Super Bet (for example, if the exact winning combination is 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-3, and the best ticket sold is 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-ALL). If there is a cancellation of the closing day's performance, the accumulated carry-over pool shall be carried over to the Harness Association next to operate that accepts Super Bet wagering.
